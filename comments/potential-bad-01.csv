"My plan was to not import or ship `Xamarin.Android.Aapt.targets` at all:

https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/02e86b5a6bbd6f938c16cf30bc709543565bb34e/src/Xamarin.Android.Build.Tasks/Xamarin.Android.Common.targets#L364-L365

However this is wrong ☝️ , it needs to be checking `$(UsingAndroidNETSdk)` instead.

This should also work:

"> I was wrong. It is not the cause of the crash in 5185.

You mean #5203?"
"> Looks like the `managedReturns` aren't being used?

I'm wrong/wasn't interpreting things correctly.  They *are* being used.

I am thus *further* confused by `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.exe`.

Background: API-R adds [`CellInfo.getCellIdentity()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellInfo#getCellIdentity()), and [`CellInfoCdma.getCellIdentity()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/CellInfoCdma#getCellIdentity()) overrides it.

These do *not* have the same return type:

```java
public class CellInfo {
    public CellIdentity getCellIdentity();
}
public class CellInfoCdma extends CellInfo {
    public CellIdentityCdma getCellIdentity();
}
```

This is fine in Java because of covariant return types.  This *isn't* fine in C#, which is why we have those `metadata` rules so that `CellInfoCdma.CellIdentity` has the same property type as `CellInfo.CellIdentity`.

This in turn means that the property types changed, which is a compatibility break:

API-29:

```csharp
namespace Android.Telephony {
	public sealed partial class CellInfoCdma : Android.Telephony.CellInfo, Android.OS.IParcelable {
		public unsafe Android.Telephony.CellIdentityCdma CellIdentity {
...
	}
}
```

API-R:

```csharp
namespace Android.Telephony {
	public sealed partial class CellInfoCdma : Android.Telephony.CellInfo, Android.OS.IParcelable {
		public unsafe Android.Telephony.CellIdentity CellIdentity {
...
	}
}
```

In a One Mono.Android.dll World Order...I'm not sure how we actually support this.  We'll need to figure that out later.

In the meantime, we have a property type change between API-29/v10.0 and API-R/v10.0.99!  This is *clearly* a compatibility break!

...and it's exactly *this* type change which the `metadata` rules were performing.  Consequently the `managedReturn`s *are* being used.

Yet `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat.exe` doesn't even mention this breakage:

https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/blob/1a6fcff8a5a68bc2b53afa948176dea9681ff0d0/tests/api-compatibility/acceptable-breakages-v10.0.99.txt

Why aren't the altered property types of `CellInfoCdma.CellIdentity` mentioned at all?"

"> Well we also need to consider size of build info before we start storing all these details .. so storing them isn’t practical esp when there are some huge projects with lots of package jsons

By this do you mean a single Project (one project in a solution of projects) can have up to 1 one package.json for each source directory under it's root? So the worst case scenario would be one package.json per source file?

Or is only one recognized package.json allowed per project?

I had thought it was 1 recognized per project (always adjacent to or above the project tsconfig), but I am aware I could be wrong.

IF it is only one package.json per project, then using the hash of the stringified collection of relevant properties would result in minimal impact on tsbuildinfo size."

At one point we had an invoke icall with a generic ```<T>``` return type, but that can't be AOTed (at least right now). So the current one returns object, which is inefficient (and kind of gross in terms of the burden it puts on both the caller and callee). We want strong types both for reliability and small, efficient codegen.

> 
> Also what's wrong with the existing `mono_wasm_invoke_js` ? (besides that it should not have `eval` and live in `EM_ASM_INT` macro, which I both fixed in my pending [PR](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/60504/files#diff-aeaa65b0a5528aaf1d5f89c138410cd639839359113f9c6a700efe2f9cf0e2caR479) .)

I could sit down and try to carefully enumerate why I think we need a new icall, but off the top of my head (this was a long design discussion that happened quite a while ago, so it's reasonable to revisit it):
* ```mono_wasm_invoke_js_with_args``` is not a tasteful API - the design does not have the traits of a good maintainable API. During the review for custom marshalers some of the same traits (weak types, boxing etc) that came up there as no-go apply to it as well.
* It's hard to optimize without compatibility breaks (for example, requiring that the method name be interned), and it's easy to hit performance pitfalls by using it in an inefficient way. Taking an object[] arg basically guarantees bad performance (the only real way to optimize the allocation out requires a ThreadLocal to be safe.)
* Many JS functions return undefined, and I think it's inappropriate to silently convert that to a null - it often indicates that you misunderstand the signature of the function you're calling and should be a failure.
* JS functions also happily accept extra arguments and sometimes will work if arguments are missing. This API makes it easy to do that, and I think we should be explicit about argument count. (The current icall doesn't enforce a callee argument count check... I could add that on the JS side if you want but I think there are cases where the callee won't have argument count data.)
* Aside from the general 'hard to optimize' problem I think making every single invoke create GC pressure is a very bad thing. We need to avoid it in the bindings.
* This new icall's signature is basically a cleaned up variation on ```mono_wasm_invoke_js_blazor``` (with the exception that the callee+caller need to collaborate to handle exceptions). I think it's best to ensure our API can efficiently be used to implement blazor, uno, etc.
* For ```mono_wasm_invoke_js```, the overhead of looking up the string literal is nonzero (especially because it's not required to be interned), and not being able to pass arguments requires the caller to do unclean things like shove arguments into globals (which is not a cheap thing to do via the current API... you'd have to do SetObjectProperty per-argument.)

My endgame for this is that we use source generators to create strongly-typed wrappers for specific methods (JS pinvoke, basically) that correctly and efficiently use this new icall under the hood. Later on those wrappers could transition to using dedicated JS and bypassing the icall machinery if necessary."
"Or actually I did something wrong, let me check..."
"@github Been deeply looking at `218913`:

With this PR, it creates a CSE for a double constant:

But because constant propagation does not happen for CSEs, constant folding does not occur and an assertion prop for `OAK_EQUAL` gets missed.

I did some tinkering with assertion prop where I could get it to recognize that the cse variable represents a constant but I don't know if we want to do that. I didn't get a lot of diffs, though it would fix this regression when combined with this PR.

But, this is part of `coreclr_tests` which does crazy things; I probably wouldn't go further than we already have."
"@github definitely relevant - we can still change stuff here until the release.

> One reason to bubble up all exceptions (if at all possible) is that developers need to be alerted of problems. Like, if there is network flakiness or some server issue, it needs to show up in error reporting. Yes, it might not make a difference during normal execution but there is still something wrong if Close fails.

Right, and that's why these problems are logged - non-critical issues which don't hinder successful execution don't necessarily have to be raised as exceptions, which interrupt the actual user experience (e.g. fail a web request although the database operation did execute successfully).

A good comparison here is what happens when calling DbConnection.Dispose; it's supposed to close an open connection, but Dispose isn't supposed to surface any errors (in general in .NET).

"Just when you think ""iOS has no padding, so it will be easy"", Apple throws you a curve ball - or a rotten apple if you like. When you set padding to 0, iOS decides that you are wrong and will use the 0 for the left/right padding, but a 6 or 8 padding for top or bottom. So, to avoid this, we have to set a ""almost zero"" padding for the top/bottom.

But no worries, iOS does not respect this fraction as it seems to trim the value. So, not only can you not set 0, but it also doesn't respect half the non-zero values! "

"> * Double-click word selection seems to treat the click and expansion coordinates as _buffer_ instead of _screen_ (resulting in the wrong range being selected)

Oof. That's bad. Thanks for catching that. It looks like the `TextBuffer::_GetPreviousFromCursor` method needs to be adjusted to take the current line width into account rather than assuming the full buffer width. If that's all it is, that should be an easy fix too.

> where the setting belongs (which level)

I think this makes sense as a global. It's next to `copyOnSelect`, so the user can expect a consistent selection interaction across all of their sessions.

> naming

`trimBlockSelection`: `<bool>`

I actually _really_ like this name. It's short. It's clear that it _only_ impacts block selection.

My only complaint could be that the trimming only happens when we copy, not when we select. But I think that's me just grasping at straws to find something wrong with it haha. And I honestly think people won't think of the setting in that way; docs, the schema description, and the SUI header should be more than enough to remove that ambiguity.

> phrasing, etc.

""Remove trailing white-spaces when copying text in rectangular selection to clipboard""

Maybe change ""rectangular"" to ""block"". I'm mildly irritated by how long it is, but I'd rather see it be descriptive than not. And I think this is ok to be ""negative"", because ""Keep trailing white-spaces..."" isn't clear that the alternative is to remove them. But yeah, definitely want more input on this one.

### Miscellaneous design thoughts

We _could_ change this setting to `trimCopiedText`, but I _really_ don't like that because I like that we're already handling trimming text pretty smart. Line selection doesn't trim, whereas block selection is up to the user. From [this comment](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/9706#issuecomment-814032515), it seems like there's already consensus on block selection being configurable in this way so this seems like a solid win for me."

"> it has DocumentResetAsync but unfortunately I can't use it since it is async method. for now, I need to stick with RemoveDocument.

Note: because you are clearing the data associate for the workspace, the methods you call should not be document-centric.  They should be workspace-centric.  Otherwise we have the wrong level of granularity, and it's totally possible for an analyzer to be caching data that won't get removed.

## 

Note: this is not a hypothetical.  This is how one of our incremental analyzers works today. SymbolTreeIncrementalAnalyzer has this code:

``` c#
            public override Task AnalyzeDocumentAsync(Document document, SyntaxNode bodyOpt, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
            {
                if (!document.SupportsSyntaxTree)
                {
                    // Not a language we can produce indices for (i.e. TypeScript).  Bail immediately.
                    return SpecializedTasks.EmptyTask;
                }

                if (bodyOpt != null)
                {
                    // This was a method level edit.  This can't change the symbol tree info
                    // for this project.  Bail immediately.
                    return SpecializedTasks.EmptyTask;
                }

                return UpdateSymbolTreeInfoAsync(document.Project, cancellationToken);
            }
```

Note that at hte bottom, we do our processing on the _Project_ of the document and we cache that data at the project level.

""RemoveDocument"" isn't even implemented by this class, so no cleanup happens at all.

## 

Now, i have no idea if this is a problem or not.  But it seems _really_ fishy that we're just calling ""RemoveDocument"" and we're expecting that to be sufficient.

This issue is pretty insidious because the example in the description shows a broken case, but the overwhelming majority of cases work, which is why I have a problem with the PR in the first place.

We have a gap with what we can express currently and a better plan is to use the analyzers/linker knowledge to fill it. I don't like the linker specific solution because there are other libraries that will have the same problem I wouldn't recommend they do what this PR does, it's just not right."

"> Are we worried we can overflow `int`? I can bump count to `long` or `ulong`. This is no longer ""the answer"" but more so the upper guess. The actual answer comes from walking the structures and counting entries we like.

It's not the underflow or the overflow, but the internal behavioral changes that are the concern. It was specifically implemented to improve portability between 32/64-bit architectures, and ultimately is an `int64_t`, but is an ABI breaking change as well. Basically the intent was to make `xinpcb` structs word-size independent. Meaning they could go down or up from an `int` and a consumer wouldn't need to handle that portion, it can just rely on the kernel to manage it.
As it currently sits, FreeBSD could overflow `int` as `kvaddr_t` is a `uint64_t`.

Relevant commit is [here](https://reviews.freebsd.org/rS335979#change-CaAchZVQnKNx) in FreeBSD, names changed and I kept forgetting about it. 
```c
struct xinpcb {
	ksize_t		xi_len;			/* length of this structure */
...
	union {
		kvaddr_t inp_ppcb;		/* (s) netstat(1) */
		int64_t	ph_ppcb;
	};
```

That said, the way netstat handles it looks to be probably the right way.
`char mibvar[sizeof ""net.local.seqpacket.pcblist""];` where `mibvar` is a switch around TCP/UDP/SCTP/raw. Then it does a walk of the pcb list in `pcblist_kvm()`. That appears to be the most correct way for both OSX and FreeBSD, but I could definitely be wrong about OSX."

CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies shouldn't be relevent for design-time build.  This is only for full-build about whether it decides to copy the libs from nuget packages.

> I thought that `iconv-lite` through webpack would support all encodings because there are no native dependencies, but please correct me if that assumption was wrong.

Your assumption is correct. It's not about native dependencies, it's about `iconv-lite` relying on the fact that it gets `Buffer` as input and not `Uint8Array`. The solution is very straightforward - adding `Buffer.from` in couple places. So in the worst case scenario we can always go with a fork.

According to the release notes this issue is fixed in 4.8.0.1269 (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/release-notes/4.8/4.8.0-pre3#issues-fixed) - which is a wrong information: the issue is still reproducible in this version. By updating Xamarin.Forms to 4.8.0.1687 we could confirm that this bug is fixed.
"Yes, that's intended. This is the one deliberate odd behaviour. When the folding provider no longer returns a region which it previously returned and which is collapsed the foldingModel logic can't easily distinguish between three possible reasons:
1. The user modified the text in such a way that the region really is gone. E.g. They deleted the opening ""{"" of a region. In this case we should unfold it.
2. The user modified the text such that the region is now embedded in a comment or a string. In this case it makes sense to keep the region folded - the user may next close the comment or string before the region. And even if they don't the fold still makes a kind of sense.
3. The folding range provider is misbehaving. Very slow to respond or responding incorrectly. Which we think is the case in the issue which got this whole thing going. In this case we want the hidden region(s) to stay hidden.

Since the foldingModel can't readily distinguish between these cases I decided to treat it as case (1) if only one hidden region is affected and unfold it, and treat it as case (2) or (3) if more than one hidden region is affected. My reasoning is that even if it is wrong in treating a situation as the first case, as it is in your example, only one fold is affected and that isn't a big hardship to the user. I expect it will nearly never be wrong when treating something the other way."

I think it's good to handle casts on conditional expressions, but if it proves more expensive/fraught, it might be necessary to drop it.

> And if we do, I'm not sure we need to have a concept of an ""acceptable"" conversion. Either there was an error during initial binding, or the result of the conversion can be nullable.

I didn't understand this part. It feels like what's important about the conversion is:

- If the conversion only gives non-null output when the input is non-null, we can propagate out the StateWhenNotNull (most built-in conversions meet this requirement).
- Otherwise, we don't know why the conversion result is non-null, and we have to discard the StateWhenNotNull of the inner conditional access.

> This doesn't look correct. I don't believe we should be walking through conversions here at all: the conversion that needs to be applied in in BoundNullCoalescingOperator.LeftConversion.

"> I had the impression that forceConsistentFileNames ignored drive roots. Sorry for not including a comment to that effect.

Yes. But your import doesnt test import ""somethingsomething/a"" and  ""somethingsomething/A"" you would get error on either one of those and that was expected behavior which is not the current case.

> I'm not sure I follow. Where is the current directory specified in this case?

Current directory need to be specified as part of the https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/41292/files#diff-742ed890d46f805d54cbcf33f4a6f2cd286a81ac5df890b0b20636445b464093R149 . We need test where current directory differs in casing from whats on the disk.

The bigger missing part is import in wrong casing should give error which it wont because the realpath will resolve to casing on the disk and then we will loose that info. But same code in case sensitive file system will give error because import will not be resolved.

Disk file name: a.ts 

import ""a"" > success
import ""A"" > will fail on case sensistive file systems... so it should error with forceConsistentFileCasing on case insensitive filesystem which it would not when realpath is invoked as part of this change."

"Thanks for the update.

I apologize for probably sounding like a crazy person before when I was talking about .laccdb files and what not.

The only way I could observe bugs from the changed transaction code was to write my own tests, and to do so, I used the driver with an accdb file (since this is my intended scenario).  I assume using the driver with text/csv will have a similar issue due to not being disposed properly, but it could be that there are two different bugs.

"This is wrong
"
"Yes, here’s the situation as I think it is occurring:

* A non-UI thread is is loading projects into the project collection. This thread acquires the read lock on the project collection.
* On the UI thread, a project finishes loading and is finalized. This fires OnAfterCreateProject which tries to get the output path of the finalized project. This causes the current project configuration to be created, which tries to set the Platform property on the project. This requires the write lock on the project collection, which it can’t have yet due to the outstanding read lock. So it blocks and pushes a message loop to pump messages while it waits.
* There is yet another non-UI thread initializing Roslyn with information from the evaluation (since the design-time build has not been run yet). This sets the compiler options for Roslyn, which calls AbstractLegacyProject.RefreshBinOutputPath. This uses IVsBuildPropertyStorage::GetValueProperty, which is bound to the UI thread. So the call is marshalled to the UI thread where we try and read a property from the project, which means we need to acquire a read lock. Since someone is waiting for the write lock, we block on the read lock, waiting for the thread requesting the write lock to complete. Unfortunately, since that is the UI thread, we deadlock.
 
Reading the comments from the code, I believed that initializing Roslyn on the background thread with just evaluation data was safe because Roslyn wouldn’t in that case call IVsBuildPropertyStorage, but obviously that belief was wrong. I thought maybe there was something different about VB, but it looks like C# does the same thing, so IDK where my belief came from.

I don't think that queueing the update to the UI thread will help, unless I'm misunderstanding the situation, because the UI thread is free in this case and the problem is the read lock being piled on top of the write lock.

This is a 16.8 bug because it causes hangs in optprof. If you're worried about other downstream issues, we could back off the background initialization of Roslyn for the time being on the project system side, which would be fine. Just let me know what you think, you're the expert here. :)"
"@github This simple approach expands `syntaxTree.IsTypeContext`, to also be true in `syntaxTree.IsLocalFunctionDeclarationContext`. The only test that fails with this addition is the `delegate` keyword recommender (test failure: `delegate` is suggested after `static`):

I'm not too confident about the `delegate` keyword, but to me, it feels like it should *not* be suggested in a type context. For instance, it is suggested in method parameters (`void M($$`), which I think is wrong. @github It probably should read `context.IsTypeDeclarationContext` in line 44?

@github What do you think about the approach of expanding `syntaxTree.IsTypeContext`? What should we do about the `DelegateKeywordRecommender`."
"Rough gist: the module names are wrong, not the import

Chatted with @github  - when you have commonjs set as the target, you basically never want a .d.ts which would look like this - the core issue is in the declared module names (nothing in the generated .d.ts here is portable) without either:

 - requiring code like `/// <amd-module-name name=""thing"" />` in some/all files
 - knowing the package for the package name and adding it to the module names:

```ts
declare module ""packagename/nested/shared"" {
    export class B {
    }
}
declare module ""packagename/nested/base"" {
    import { B } from ""packagename/nested/shared"";
    export function f(): B;
}
declare module ""packagename/nested/derived"" {
    export function g(): import(""packagename/nested"").B;
}
declare module ""packagename/nested"" {
    export * from ""packagename/nested/base"";
    export * from ""packagename/nested/derived"";
    export * from ""packagename/nested/shared"";
}
declare module ""packagename"" {
    export * from ""packagename/nested"";
}
```

Which could come from a compiler option. (an implicit look up wouldn't work in all cases) - Wes feels this is worth it.

"The costs you highlight for GetEnvironmentVariable are because the runtime reads and stores the UTF8 env vars on first use,  and then calls to GetEnvironmentVariable need to transcode the UTF16 key being searched for, which is done linearly.  To make GetEnvironmentVariable faster in microbenchmarks, the runtime could instead pre-transcode them all and potentially store them in a hashtable. The problem, though, is trying to optimize for microbenchmarks on the throughput of GetEnvironmentVariable will likely lead you to do the ""wrong"" thing.  No one should be calling GetEnvironmentVariable on a hot path; instead, while there are exceptions to this, it's generally used once for a given key, often during startup / first use of some code that checks it for configuration info and then never looks at it again; in my experience,  there are also generally many more environment variables in the environment than the app actually cares about. We could spend way more time transcoding all env vars, find we made a benchmark.net test of GetEnvironmentVariable much faster, but actually slowed down the overall startup of an app with no measurable reward to show for it. If you'd like to prototype that and can demonstrate it does help with the overall startup of various app types (e.g. because it turns out we end up looking for lots of environment variables, maybe multiple times, or because we have to transcode them all anyway for an inevitable call to GetEnvironmentVariables, plural), then we could certainly consider that direction. It would make multiple calls to GetEnvironmentVariables faster as well. 

(It's also possible there are some simpler, smaller optimizations possible. For example, if the vast majority of keys are ASCII, maybe there could be a fast-path that skips the transcoding initially and tries to do the comparison between the byte and char unless a non-ASCII value is hit.)"
"There's a conflict from there being two kinds of errors that typically get suppressed: code quality and type checking.

Code quality errors are produced by settings like `noUnusedLocals`. These errors don't always mean that your code is wrong so suppressing them can be justified since they don't affect the correctness of your program. Adding ranged suppressions can be useful in case there are many errors, as in @github's use case.

Type errors are different. Ignoring these errors isn't a magic ""make my code work"" button. Ignoring them can have unintended consequences on how the rest of your code is checked. They should never be ignored unless there's absolutely no other way of getting around the problem (and I've never seen an example of this). There's no valid use case for range suppressions of type checking errors; we should encourage people to fix their types and not ignore errors.

This dilemma should be resolved in favour of not adding ranged suppressions. The TSC diagnostics system is basically unconfigurable and it's impossible to ignore specific kinds of errors (which is fine for type checking but less for linting). If you need more control over code quality diagnostics than what TSC provides you can use something like ESLint."

That sounds wrong. Repositories which produce tools that we depend on shouldn't update their SDK at a faster cadence than us.

"1-byte default for bool is likely wrong more than 50% of the time and it will have to be overridden most of the time. Given that, I think it would be better to make the marshaling directive for bool mandatory.

It matches the approach that we took with string marshaling. There is no great default for string marshaling and so we require it to be always specified explicitly.  "
"I looked most everything over just to familiarize myself with the changes (except morph). Will go back through in more detail tomorrow and write up some specific feedback.

Overall I agree this looks like a very nice cleanup.

Seems like we use the ""enumerate early args then late args"" pattern quite often, I wonder if some sort of combined iterator makes sense.

Also wonder if we can come up with some kind of safeguards to make it harder to look at the wrong enumerations. Or maybe find better descriptive names?"
"The single diff is due to a new CSE which happens due to us using wrong handle types in `impTokenToHandle` when `importParent` is true. We have two `CORINFO_HELP_NEWSFAST` calls with the same handles except one of them is marked as a method instead of token, and after some arithmetic we can now CSE them.

I am fixing the `impTokenToHandle` problem as part of #70437."
"Generally the user manager does all of the validations, errors at the store level are usually something going really wrong, like you mucked with the schema, or for this bug, you have duplicate emails in your db and try to use it like a key"
You don't need include and exclude patterns. The reason is that anything that is not included will be already excluded. Am I wrong?

I'm assuming there's no use case for exiting the debugging state within a given browser tab. If that's wrong then I guess we'd need more logic to delete the `sessionStorage` entry if it's becoming false.

>rewrittenArguments = factory.MakeTempsForDiscardArguments(rewrittenArguments, temporariesBuilder); [](start = 16, length = 98)

I believe this is a wrong place for this operation, it should be performed before the ""__arglist"" check (see [https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/19382](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/19382)). I understand that this is preexisting problem, but I suggest to move this code out of this function, into MakeArguments right before this function is called. This will make the code cleaner because we will be able to get rid of the ```factory``` and ```temporariesBuilder``` parameters, and the conditional logic associated with them.

"> The version of Microsoft.NET.Compilers.Toolset that's shipping as part of the the SDK is 3.8.0-5.20570.14

That was true at 5.0 RTM but has changed with every bug fix we take to the compiler. There have been two such fixes since RTM. We should make sure we understand how this process works to ensure Razor has the Roslyn bits it's expected to be getting. Think that can be a follow up discussion though. 

> Both of these get the compiler version through a single project / package reference:

This is still where I'm stuck. If they both get their version from a single project reference then how did they get out of sync at all? I can definitely understnad how they would be the wrong version but not how they would be out of sync.

"> there is nothing wrong

Yes there is.  features that are coded differently and work differently than the rest of the IDE act as a tax on future maintainers.  It means that instead of having uniform patterns and approaches to solving problems, the maintainer has to figure out why things are done differently.  That's why we create supplementary APIs to address these common patterns, and why we want all our features to use them.  please do not be different here. This feature is not special and does not warrant side-stepping the infrastructure we've spent over a decade building.  

This is the philosophy we take with all our code action features (regardless of whether they are internally or externally contributed)."
Ah got it. That's crazy though.

This means that, if there are no children, the entire node will disappear. This feels wrong. The VisitNoneOperationStatement has the same problem, BTW.

"It's unfortunate we're adding another allocation.  We could explore ways to avoid it, e.g. using a type like:

{
    private readonly Timer _timer;
    private readonly CancellationTokenRegistration _reg1;
    private readonly CancellationTokenRegistration _reg2;

    public volatile bool TimerFired;

    public LinkedTimedCancellationTokenSource(CancellationToken token1, CancellationToken token2, TimeSpan timeout)
    {
        Action<object> cancelCallback = s => ((LinkedTimedCancellationTokenSource)s).Cancel();
        _reg1 = token1.UnsafeRegister(cancelCallback);
        _reg2 = token2.UnsafeRegister(cancelCallback);
        _timer = new Timer(s =>
        {
            var thisRef = (LinkedTimedCancellationTokenSource)s;
            thisRef.TimerFired = true;
            try { thisRef.Cancel(); } catch (ObjectDisposedException) { }
        }, this, timeout, Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan);
    }

    protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        _timer.Dispose();
        _reg2.Dispose();
        _reg1.Dispose();
        base.Dispose(disposing);
    }
}
```
and then constructing one of these when a timeout is set, e.g.
```C#
if (hasTimeout || cancellationToken.CanBeCanceled)
{
    disposeCts = true;
    cts = hasTimeout ?
        LinkedTimedCancellationTokenSource(cancellationToken, _pendingRequestsCts.Token, timeout) :
        CancellationTokenSource.CreateLinkedTokenSource(cancellationToken, _pendingRequestsCts.Token);
}
```
That then also implicitly handles the rooting issue, avoids the need to pass around the additional Timer (since it's encapsulated in the CTS), etc.

I'm not sure if it's worth it, but we already allocate a bunch of objects per request, and one of the things we want to look at in this release is driving that down, so increasing it is going in the wrong direction, especially when we end up paying it on all requests in order to handle an exceptional case."

"I've read your comments just now, but I'm not sure I understand them entirely...
First of all: Is there a security issue with the current code?

The way I understand this, we don't check the security info during writing which can cause us to create a file with the wrong security info despite `elevatedOnly` being true, right? But is that an issue if we delete that file during `ReadUTF8File` anyways? I personally don't mind this being a ""waste of time"", because this would be a situation that can only be created artificially, for instance by a user creating the file themselves... As such it's unlikely to occur in practice, isn't it?"

"It's possible. Don't get us wrong there. It's just that I don't think it's likely to happen. Significantly less likely to happen than me just updating the documentation to explain the way the world is and make recommendations on which path to use.

If I had to hazard a guess (and this is a guess based on my personal experience, please don't misinterpret it as some declaration)...
- GDI has been generally superseded by the DirectX family of graphics technologies
- GDI is a kernel-mode based technology which we generally don't favor anymore primarily due to security
- GDI is old so its behavior and quirks are relied on by a large swath of existing software so any change is risky
- GDI is old... so none of the original owners or decision makers are around to inform changes anymore
- The team that owns GDI likely owns a handful of other technologies and areas that are more relevant to modern development
- This particular issue is new or hasn't been popular enough, on a broad developer market scale, for it to rank higher than the other ongoing work

I would guess that a combination of all of these factors go into the unlikelihood that `PolyTextOut` will be updated at this point.

I will have no problem in looking these sorts of things up for you now and in the future. And I also have no problem updating the official public documentation to help better inform you and others."

"This fixes two issues
1.  We would hit a null ref on line 384 if all of the completion items had default commit characters (aka the commit characters field on every completion item was null). 
2.  The algorithm is trying to promote the most used commit character set onto the list itself, then null out commit chars on any completion item using that set to save serialization.  However this skipped _originally_ null commit chars (indicating that the item should use commit chars from `Initialize`).  This resulted in the _second most used_ commit char set being promoted to the `CompletionList.CommitChars`, and both items with default chars and second most used commit chars having their commit chars nulled out.  This means for items that originally had null commit chars (aka use default from `Initialize`), the client would use the wrong commit chars from the completion list."
"Just tried out giving it an atbitrary file path and let it throw. Don't see any error diaglog/indicator from the UI.

I could be reading the documentation wrong though (_and on second re-read I think I read it wrong_ 😩).

`SockersHttpHandler` on Android may be tricky and I am aware of the limitations in `SslStream` implementation. For something like `NSUrlSessionHandler` it would be possible to expose `DangerousAcceptAnyTrust` callback and assign it through reflection to `TrustOverrideForUrl`."
"> the position is resetet in CheckContentSignatureAsync

The streams involved here aren't seekable.

> why do you think it is not useful?

Because doing this correctly adds cost to workaround a server that's actively doing the wrong thing.  There are a myriad of ways it could be doing the wrong thing, and by returning the data without error, it's only working around this one very specific way the server is doing it wrong, and in doing so, passing along effectively corrupt data to the consumer.  What if the server said it was speaking gzip but sent down data as zlib or deflate?  What if the server said it was speaking gzip but didn't send the gzip header, only the compressed body and gzip footer?  Etc."

"> This is exactly the same as InstrumentSwitchStatementExpression, InstrumentCatchClauseFilter and others which you added but without the same kind of tests that you now seem to think are required. How did you eliminate your doubts then?

I assume the scenarios are tested under umbrella of dynamic analysis tests. I also had more context at the time, given that the feature was under active development and I was working on it. Right now, I am reviewing the code, the code that is either new, or significantly modified since then. The code that appears to use some different logic around invoking instrumentation. All I have to go from - is my intuition, which might or might not be wrong. If you are so against adding tests, I suggest a compromise - let's remove usage of the new API from the product and start using it when we can easily test its actual effect under different conditions, or add a PROTOTYPE comment in the right place to catch up on testing later.

"Ok.  So normal time here is 5 seconds on first run.  However, even with this PR we go to 30 seconds.   That's a 6x regression in perf here.  I imagine multiple runs will also incur perf issues.  Any sort of change (like an edit to the compiler layer) will force compilations and skeletons to be recreated for everything higher.

I'm planning on doing some work where we can allow stale results to eb returned.  I think i'll likely also make it so that during solution load we just do not run SGs. The perf hit is just too crazy high, and interferes significantly with trying to get results in a reasonable amount of time.

I think it's likely reasonable that we can say during loading that we dont' give SG results.  This is esp. so as we already put an notification in the NavTo box saying that results may be incomplete at this time."

Thanks for getting back to me! I really wasn't sure whether to prioritize making fewer changes and making it work with what's already there or to make changes like you suggested. I tried to think of how to solve the problem while making the smallest number of changes, then take one step towards what I would consider ideal. I wasn't sure what kind of philosophy there is about these kinds of things so I just guessed. Since my guess was wrong, I'll go back and make the changes I think would be ideal instead of trying to guess where my hands should be tied. I did kinda deviate from that anyway and got caught up a bit when I noticed a bunch of other issues while looking at the code. I will work on this more this week. I'll make this better.

"> am I doing something wrong with /t:UpdateRuntimeJson? Should it have worked out of the box?

It would have when running pack.  If you aren't packing you can run the target directly.  I think the docs are unclear about this since they say ""rebuild the project"" which made sense when it was a dedicated pkgproj but is no longer the best wording now that it's a CSProj.  I'm fine with the update you made to the docs. "
"I guess my initial diagnosis of this issue was wrong. It turns out that `ins_Store(varTypes dstType)` meaning it expects the type of destination. The node that we are trying to codegen is storing the `float` to a static field and needs redirection of offset which is done using `STOREIND`. Currently we correctly pass the `tree->TypeGet()` to it instead of `data->TypeGet()`.

```
N039 ( 22, 20) [000004] --CXG--------        t4 = *  CALL      float  TestClass.Method1 REG f0 $280
                                                   /--*  t8     byref  
                                                   +--*  t4     float  
N041 ( 11, 15) [000015] -ACXG--------             *  STOREIND  int    REG NA
```

The right thing that should happen IMO is using the following:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/7638249ee53ad7eaa835f1ffe0bc8acaaaa57476/src/coreclr/jit/emitarm.cpp#L7843-L7844

which means, we should do a `vmov tmpReg, t4` and then `str tmpReg [reg+offset]`, but that code is only kicked when `if ((indir->gtFlags & GTF_IND_UNALIGNED))` which happens in importer. Investigating why that is not set.

Also, for x86, the return type of `Method1` is `int` instead of `float` (done during lowering). Need to check that too. Since the type `TYP_INT` matches for both `t4` (the data) and the `tree` (`STOREIND` node), we don't see it happen on other platforms.

```
N014 ( 20, 14) [000004] --CXG-------         t4 = *  CALL      int    TestClass.Method1 $280

"I think what's going on is that there is an expectation that the PSP sym for both main method and funclet is the same delta from CallerSP. There is just one offset for this in the gc info.

This isn't the case currently; the OSR method delta includes the Tier0 frame size but we don't pad out the OSR funclet frame to match.

So we end up with a situation where we report PSPSym offset in gc info as -80 from Caller SP. For the OSR frame this is (-16 osr part of frame) + (-64 tier0 frame) and is fine.

But this offset doesn't work for the funclet; it's PSP sym is at (-16) with respect to Caller SP. So when we try and find the PSP sym value for the funclet we end up with the wrong value and things go downhill from there.

Options are to either pad the funclet frame or to have the OSR frame use the Tier0 frame's PSP Sym slot. The latter seems appealing but may not be possible as the PSP sym location varies depending on which regs get saved, and this differs between Tier0 frame and OSR frame (eg in this case the Tier0 PSP sym offset is at (-8).). If we tried to normalize for that by saving PSPSym first after varargs we might run into issues because the Tier0 frame spills varargs at top of frame and there's no reason for the OSR frame to do this (but see [note](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62831#issuecomment-995371599)).

So as ugly as it seems, we may need to pad the funclet frame to include a phantom tier0 frame."

"> @github bad rebase? wrong branch?

The original assertion was wrong here. We want this to generate strong typed stuff that won't try to do conversions. This is an update based on changes to the compiler that fixed the underlying issue.
"Wow, I remember the fixer doing a pretty good job even when fixing all instances of a problem in an entire (albeit filtered) solution. What went wrong e.g. is there an issue or three we should report in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers❔"

"Adding Inputs/Outputs would break the correctness of this target. Imagine you do a build, everything completes. Then a build the second time and now your target *won't* run, which means you'll end up being in the bad state. You might end up in some fun situation where then every other build would be ""right"" and then ""wrong"".

Another way to think about it: Inputs/Outputs are a statement that ""this target consumes the _contents_ of those files""...this target doesn't."

">return BindTupleBinaryOperator(node, kind, left, right, diagnostics) [](start = 20, length = 68)

It feels wrong to call this when we already detected that there is an error and possibly ignore the fact. Also it looks like we might have done a lot of things above (created some conversions, etc.) that already could have produced errors that won't be expected if we are able to successfully bind tuple equality/inequality. I think that tuple equality should be handled similar  to other built-in operators and should be folded into logic in BinaryOperatorOverloadResolution. #Closed"
"At first I just blindly implemented this to be same as ChangeParseOptions, but after thinking about this, this seems wrong. If this returns false for ChangeParseOptions and CanApplyParseOptionChange returns true, CheckAllowedProjectChanges is still fine with such a change. Therefore CanApplyChange(ChangeParseOptions) really seems to be asking ""Can you change *any* parse options"" rather than ""Are you able to change *some* parse options"". Having this return true actually means that this workspace is fine will any kinds of parse/compilation option changes regardless of CanApplyParseOptionChange and will likely crash if that is done."

"Ok.  dumb question before i go review all this... why is updating transitive references not simple (given that we already have an *existing* valid direct-reverse-reference map?

So i am adding references R1 to RN to Project P1.  Ok.  So i first add it to the 'trans references' set for P1.  I then use my reverse dep map to see who references P1, i get Pq, Pr, Ps.  I go add these references to those three projects.  I then recurse on those.   And i basically back propagate the references added to P1, backwards updating anything as necessary.

"> Is that potentially due to an assumption that TYP_SIMD8 means System.Numerics.Vector2, 

We correctly determine it to be intrinsic API and return [vector size as 8 bytes](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/vm/class.cpp#L1204), but then over [here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/vm/jitinterface.cpp#L346) `eeType=ELEMENT_TYPE_R8 (0n13)` maps to `CORINFO_TYPE_DOUBLE`. I am not much familiar with this method, but I believe somewhere after we get that value (probably inside [getPrimitiveTypeForStruct](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/jit/compiler.cpp#L544) or [getReturnTypeForStruct](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/jit/compiler.cpp#L971) we should see if this is simd type and map to one of `TYP_SIMD8`.

In general the arg list here was only used interestingly for JIT helpers, so I have folded them in as optional arguments in `gtNewHelperCallNode` that takes care of setting the flags.

For user calls, `impImportCall` will use `impPopCallArgs` and set the flags from the arguments after this. With that said, I have reviewed the sites that use `impPopCallArgs` and it looks like I have missed the flags in a couple of places... will fold it into `impPopCallArgs`.

I have also considered making `CallArgs` handle it when inserting arguments. It should be easy to get a back-pointer to the parent `GenTreeCall` given that it is stored inline.

This PR also improves the default mode, but only by a few %s in general.

2) It should ignore methods with insufficient samples (currently if callsite's profile >= callsite's fgFirstBb->weight -- we consider it as hot) e.g. static constructors, etc
3) Re-vise ""report noinline to vm"" logic, sometimes it might bake ""noinline"" for methods which are good candidates for inlining within specific call-sites (e.g. with const args).

"> I'm not very familiar with workspaces

but you created this API 😄 

I'll mention the two options again. This API could be interpreted in 2 ways:
- `CanApplyChange(ApplyChangesKind.ChangeParseOptions)` returning true means the workspace is able to change *some* parse options - you don't know whether it can handle the option you want until you additionally call `CanApplyParseOptionChange`. So in this scenario, `CanApplyChange` really basically tells you nothing about what you can actually do. This *might have been* the original intent (but implemented incorrectly).
-  `CanApplyChange(ApplyChangesKind.ChangeParseOptions)` returning true means the workspace supports changing parse options, period. Any kind of change, and you can count on that. Now it may also support changing some specific options even if this returns false. If you check `CanApplyParseOptionChange`, you might find out that is the case. This is the existing implementation.

@github I see you're suggesting we should really have the first option. I think both of them make sense, but if we go with first, then the default value of `CanApplyCompilationChange` being false is wrong and would be a breaking change. Basically, until now, if you get true from `CanApplyChange(ApplyChangesKind.ChangeCompilationOptions)` you know the workspace supports changing any compilation options, but if we implement this the way you're suggesting, the new meaning would be ""no, this actually doesn't supports changing compilation options at all because `CanApplyCompilationChange` still always returns false"". If we go with number 1, the default implementation should return true. But there's also a problem that the existing implementation of `CanApplyParseChange` returns false. Meh :-/"

The contrapositive to this is: would be handled differently => new exception type

> It’s OK for exceptions to have a property

Each exception can carry two main pieces of information: the exception
message explaining to the developer what went wrong and how to fix it,
and the exception type that should be used by handlers to decide what programmatic
action to take. If you think you need to have a property on your
exception that would return additional error code, ask yourself who this
code is for. Is it for the developer or for the exception handler? If for the
developer, add additional information to the message. If for the handlers,
add a new exception type."

If I understood your concerns correctly, when the `titleHeight` is increased/decreased due to a new row of tabs being added/removed, the `editorHeight` doesn't properly update when `editorGroupView#layout` is called? When testing, I don't see that issue, am I missing something?:

>-  ...title control layout which returns its height that it ended up using

I can definitely try to cleanup the logic and have `titleAreaControl#layout` return it's height and recalculate the `editorHeight` based upon that.

> With this algorithm I would also think that you do not need to know the editor height, you can simply pass the overall height into the title control layout and then decide from within if the title should wrap or not.

Again I probably misunderstand what's going on, but is this not already being done in the `editorGroupView#layout` that was linked above? The `editorHeight` property I created for the group view was an attempt at fixing the overflowing tabs issue, I can remove that for now since it's currently not working/unnecessary.

> I would think that the tabs title control should have an event that is fired whenever the height changes and the editor group can register on that to trigger redraw.

Sure, I can create an event that fires when the height of the `tabsContainer` changes from what it previously was. However, I don't think the editor group can call `redraw`, would `editorGroupView#relayout` instead be called, thereby replacing this line?:

"Okay my immediate thoughts are around how we expose this action to the user. We're already running into similar struggles with `next/prevTab` and the tab switcher, so maybe we should try and pre-empt those issues with pane switching?

For reference, there's also discussion in #8025 that might be helpful.

So, with next/prev MRU switching, without some sort of dialog, those will just toggle between the last two used panes. If there's a fourth pane, that pane will be inaccessible with next/prev pane.

Also, having panes in the ATS is something we might want some day, with something like:

> * Tab 1:
>   - **Pane 1: cmd.exe**
>   - Pane 2: pwsh.exe
> * Tab 2:
>   - Pane 1: wsl.exe

whatever, you get it.

Plus, do we want to enable in-order next/prev traversal? Once we have pane IDs, then presumably, yea.

// - This is sensible, no arguments here
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusPane"", ""id"": 1 } },

// Focus the next in order pane, don't use the switcher
// - We'd have to ensure that an id and order aren't passed at the same time, and that might be unintuitive
// - How do we specify next/prev? ""direction"" seems wrong, but maybe we keep the
//   FocusDirection(up|down|left|right|next|prev) enum and have one focus action 
//   to rule them all
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusPane"", ""order"": ""inOrder"", useSwitcher"": false } },

// Focus the next MRU pane
// - Withough the switcher, this can only go one pane deep in the MRU stack
// - presumably once there's a pane switcher, it would default to enabled?
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusNextPane"", ""order"": ""mru"" } },

// Focus the prev inOrder pane
// - this seems straightforward
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusPrevPane"", ""order"": ""inOrder"" } },

// Focus the next pane, in mru order, explicitly disable the switcher
// - The user opted in to only being able to MRU switch one deep. That's fine, that's what they want.
{ command"": { ""action"": ""focusNextPane"", ""order"": ""mru"", ""useSwitcher"": false} },

// Focus the prev inOrder pane, explicitly with the switcher

Now, `!!` takes care of throwing if `localSignature` is null. So at the point of `if (signatureSize > 0)` we know for a fact that `localSignature` is not null but the exception would point them to `localSignature`. 

It's not a regression as the same inputs give you the same outputs but as a user this now reads wrong to me and I think an `ArgumentException` would be better suited now."

"Re breaking changes:
> Loading the runtime when given an invalid delegate type

I think this is good - you're right that we should not do any work if we know it's going to fail. So I like this change in general (I have yet to look at the implementation details).
As for the risk of taking this - I think it's very small, we still fail, and we avoid loading runtime. This is very unlikely to break people (not counting that it's very unlikely that anybody released an app which calls the API with the wrong value as it would not work anyway).

> Error code when trying to load SCD component

I'm not sure about this one. I do agree that the returned value is not great (misleading to say the least). That said I know about several cases where the exact exist code is used by calling code to make decisions. So changing it feels risky to me. If this would be a change in the runtime I would not worry too much as we're OK taking small breaking changes in major releases (with good reason). Unfortunately this is a change in `hostfxr` which doesn't really have the same freedom - it's global and callers always end up calling the latest version. So even minor breaking changes are a problem.

I think we should not make this change - I know the number value is bad, but we at least print out the right error message."

"> The manual approach starts with a ⚠ clear call-out saying it is not the recommended testing strategy for source generator authors, but remains listed to serve as documentation for how the backing APIs work

Fundamentally do not agree with this. There is nothing wrong with writing tests the old way (customers and ourselves have been doing it this way for years). There are plenty of established patterns for approaching this that are in high use. The existence of the test framework does not render these invalid nor does it warrant a caution here. 
"
"Closing out for now.  @github makes a good point that this can likely interfere with the user option to use named types over predefined types.  That's solvable, but likely risky.  We can return to this another time.  Note that thsi does mean that some of our features likely get this option wrong *if* they are using SyntaxGenerator to synthesize types.  "
"I don't quite follow. 

Just to help me out, what does the return value from Unregister mean, exactly? Am I correct in assuming that true == not cancelled and false == cancelled, or is this wrong? Does it somehow depend on whether the CancellationToken was cancelled at the time of registration? (in which case the return value is determined by a race, and therefore meaningless?)

Yeah, it's calling the wrong constructor now. I'll need to modify the test in the morning. "
"My intuition tells me that we are likely taking a ""wrong"" approach for achieving the goal. I feel like a better approach would be to revert relevant parts of  #46308 instead of adding special APIs to neutralize their effect. We could simply remove the effect in the first place. I also think that it might make sense to deal with top level statements at the same time and in the same manner (finding the PR that changed the behavior for them), because they are likely to be closely related in terms of implementation strategy. Records probably build on top of what was added for top level statements, etc. And dealing with them together is likely to be much easier, more code can be removed at once rather than carefully trying to maintain an undesired behavior for one feature, but not for the other.

"> I have seen community feedback has been that the more info we include the better

We've also seen the community complain about stack trace text being overly noisy/confusing and then being very happy when work was done to simplify it (for example Ben Adams added the StackTraceHidden attribute to remove frames).

I'm not convinced this feature will be easy for most devs to use even if we leave it on by default. Converting the IL offsets back into source line offsets requires the developer gives a path to the correct build's PDBs. Unlike dump debugging we have no way to warn them if they specify the wrong ones (because there is no module versioning info in the output text).

I also lean towards saying this behavior should be off by default for this release as we continue to get feedback. We could always blog about this or put it in our docs as alternate ways to spread awareness.

`AppContext.BaseDirectory` sounds more interesting, but it is also not _semantically_ what we want, though I agree it is super likely to be correct. And, it's immutable, and set ""outside"" of the logic of the app (that is, the app doesn't decide for itself once it's running what the value should be). Same story with `Assembly.GetEntrypointAssembly().Location`.

How will the rest of MAUI figure out from where to load assets? Presumably the same exactly logic will apply, no? I think ``AppContext.BaseDirectory` likely the safest bet but we also need to be consistent with all of MAUI."

I see no benefit to have this method in this type, it is better to not mix decoding of what is in attribute with its semantic analysis. For simple cases like this (nothing to decode, no args to decode, etc) we do all the processing inside ```DecodeWellKnownAttributeAppliedToMethod```, including all error reporting. Especially that some errors are context depended, i.e. when the attribute is applied to a non-static or an inaccessible method, etc. It is fine to extract the code into a local function within ```DecodeWellKnownAttributeAppliedToMethod``` or a private helper next to it.

Regarding diagnostics, I believe the rules are rather simple and there aren't that many of them. So, I am surprised to hear that the code is going to be that complex. But I might be wrong.

An object should encapsulate it's own behaviour knowing nothing about the world. If there should be a property like AutoClose, It should reside in the container that contains items because then that is it's responsibility. but to put AutoClose in an object for the sake of desired client behaviour is wrong OOP.

Can I use SwipeView outside listing scenario? Yes, hence AutoClose is violating OOP if you put in this class.

"@github this is the location I was talking about yesterday where I managed to get the binder usage down to just one call: http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp/Binder/Semantics/OverloadResolution/MethodTypeInference.cs,1334 (the rest of the usages in the chain can be replaced by passing the nested thing on the binder it's accessing). Unfortunately, that last call doesn't seem to be easily fixable. The only time `_binder` should be null is when we're binding the body of an unbound lambda, trying to figure out the return type of that lambda. I'm not certain getting the binder from the compilation is the right thing to do here, particularly around speculation and potentially getting the wrong binder for such cases. Do you have any thoughts?

I still have a bit of other work to do on this PR around using/foreach dispose argument binding, so no rush on this question. #Closed"
"`takeOwnership` will not help. Every result is written to the rented or stack-allocated buffer. So there is no way to escape it using this parameter. The buffer passed to `BigInteger(ReadOnlySpan<uint>)` ctor must be copied using `ToArray` in any case.

Anyway, I tried to use assumption that most operations don't have leading zeroes and use heap-allocated arrays instead of renting or stack-alloc. I can conclude that this assumption is wrong because in 50% of cases the result contains leading zeroes. `BigInteger(ReadOnlySpan<uint>)` ctor in attempt to conserve space creates truncated copy of the original array. As a result, we have redundant allocation of the array for the result.

Let me explain this fact in details and choose `Add` operation for example. Before doing arithmetic operation for non-trivial operands I need to pre-allocate buffer for the result. The size of the result buffer is `Max(Digits(X), Digits(Y)) + 1` where `Digits` pseudo-function is the number of digits in the specified operand. In our case it's a length of the uints array. After computation the reserved highest position in the buffer may remain unused and must be removed from the resulting array. I see no way to predict the usage of reserved position in the result buffer and apply decision about correct allocation strategy. That's why `takeOwnership` in the current implementation not useful."

"We usually don't throw `NotImplementedException`. The [docs say](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.notimplementedexception.aspx):

> 1. You've designed a type in which you want to include a particular member as part of its public interface, but intend to provide the implementation in a later version. In this case, you can throw a NotImplementedException exception for versions on which the functionality is not implemented, and provide an implementation for later versions.
> 2. You've designed a type with one or more members that are available on some platforms or in some versions but not on others. In this case, you can throw a NotImplementedException exception on platforms on which the functionality is not supported.
> 3. You're creating an abstract base class with some members for which you want to provide no implementation but expect derived class to provide the implementation when they override the member. In this case, your member can throw a NotImplementedException exception.

I'd say that (1) is extremely odd and you shouldn't be doing this. Until you implement something you don't know whether the design works. (2) is just plain wrong, the code should throw `PlatformNotSupportedException`. (3) seems more reasonable and is basically the case here.

My high-level feedback would be that you should avoid adding virtual members that throw. Instead, I'd try to ensure that design has a reasonable default implementation, for instance, by forwarding to existing APIs. If that's not possible, at least add some actionable message. Simply failing with `NotImplementedException` will look like a bug in Roslyn.

"We have plans to bring it back, but with a different name, and without the error requiring its use - some contention was had that the name `bundledPackageName` potentially implied that we were some kind of full service bundler, rather than a relatively dumb concatenator."
"> Does that approach scale given how large the Unicode BMP is

Fortunately, we only need to test the ranges in `s_lcTable` that are tagged as `LowercaseAdd`. I wrote some simple code to find cases where `char.ToLower(AChar) != UpperCaseAChar + offset` from the ranges in `s_lcTable` and fixed all the cases I found were wrong."
"Re-reading it, I think I put the specifier in the wrong location on that comment -- I edited the description a couple months after the design meeting, so it's more up-to-date than the comment.

Basically, the change should exempt properties that whose declarations *all* come from outside a class, unless they're synthetic, in which case they are exempt if any declaration comes from outside a class.

I don't know what support we had for accessors in interfaces and type literals at the time, but it definitely sounds like they behave the same as classes now. I'll update the code to implement that."
"> @github Yes, ""unfortunately"" -- that would have been a hint indeed that something was wrong/changed from before.

Would adding a manual check for the presence of files under the Analyzers node be a good early warning sign, to avoid the long investigation through multiple teams to track this down? Or is it no better a signal than ""the whole document has red squiggles"" which got us here?"
"Suppressions are a hack for hacking your way out of issues a cast won't fix (like weird inheritance issues). But a cast will fix almost any issue (even those issues if you're creative with where you cast and to what) - every example you have here can be fixed with a single `any` cast (on the receiver, library itself, or argument), which is much better handled in the language. In other cases, where you have a massive chunk of unchecked code, the per-file directive is fine. If a third party lib has the wrong type, you cast to the correct type or `any`, up to you, a suppression is completely incorrect and the wrong solution to the problem.

Honestly, we thought suppressions were a bad idea to begin with and I had to argue they had uses when migrating JS projects to TS (essentially as automatable TODOs since per issue suppressions are easy to place automatically). But some people turn to them rather than the much simpler cast, and seeing the arguments here just reinforces that - suppressions aren't ""better"" than a cast - they're much much worse, and they leave the compiler in a silent error state where things may not behave as expected. They are an absolute last resort, and _honestly_ the presence of a suppression should itself be an error, to indicate that the project has unchecked code that may have unintended cascading effects on downstream code (like quietly leaking an `any` that isn't caught by `noImplicitAny`).

If anyone is left thinking a suppression like this is their only possible solution, then we've failed in our documentation somewhere - even in JS we support jsdoc casts now, so you can cast out of almost any issues in JS, too. (Even missing imports can be fixed with `declare module` declarations)"

If cancellation is requested at just the ""wrong"" time, we may end up canceling the operation but reporting it as a successful completion, due to our relying on _registration.Token being the caller-provided token, but that not being the case if cancellation was requested prior to UnsafeRegister being called, in which case it'll return a default registration.

"> Ah, so the native library (which sees the type as an enum/integer) still does single register, but since the P/Invoke Marshaller sees the type as a struct it tries unpacking it per struct rules, resulting in a mismatch?

Exactly.  The marshaller prepares a buffer on the stack, and passes a pointer to that buffer to the native routine, expecting the native routine to fill (what it thinks to be) the struct to be returned in.   But native code thinks it returns an integer, and so doesn't expect a buffer pointer but simply returns the integer in register.   (Plus the presence of the return pointer shifts the other arguments by one slot, which native code also doesn't expect, so the incoming arguments are already wrong.)"

Related to #54417 

The contract is:
* The runtime defines `_MonoRuntimeAvailableComponents` which is an item list like `""hot_reload;diagnostic_tracing""`
* The workoad defines `_MonoComponent` which is some subset of the times that makes sense in the current configuration of the user app
* The workload calls the `_MonoSelectRuntimeComponents` target
  * The target returns `_MonoRuntimeSelectedComponents` (and `_MonoRuntimeSelectedStubComponents` if static linking) which are the _names_ of the comopnents that will be available (or stubbed out, if static linking)
  * The target returns `_MonoRuntimeComponentLink` which is a list of _filenames_ (relative to the runtime pack `native/` subdirectory) of the libraries that must be either copied (for dynamic loading) or statically linked (for static linking) with the runtime.  The items also have some metadata such as `IsStub`, `ComponentName` and `Linking`

---

**TODO**

- [ ] Right now the `component-manifest.props` is generated from `component-manifest.props.in` when the nuget is built.  this is **wrong**:
   - the `component-manifest.props` file is RID-dependent for two reasons: whether we do static or dynamic linking of components depends on the target platform, and the file extensions also depend on the platform.
   - the list of components is currently hardcoded in the pkgproj, but it should really come from the source of truth: src/mono/mono/component/CMakeLists.txt

Roslyn analysers have been shipping them with this flag turned for a while now. generators are self contained so i don't expect to leak the assembly version to someplace else. The mitigation in case of a low probability event can be handled by pinning to a higher version.

The next loop runs from 71...136, but we've moved the first part of the loop down past the seocnd, so that 136 now sits above 71. And when we try to compact that loop we walk off the end of the bbNext chain.

"Should we skip this test instead? I don't really want to encode wrong behavior in tests. It's better to just skip if possible.

"> The one that signalr catches and handles gracefully is WebsocketException when reason = ClosedWithoutSendingCloseFrame

This is a behavior we've gone back and forth about. Customers have been adamant that this kind of error is too noisy, but it still feels wrong that we suppress it. The reality is that any failure to complete the closing process is considered an error by the spec.

Also, the underlying [WebSocket implementation](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/Common/src/System/Net/WebSockets/ManagedWebSocket.cs) won't ever actually produce IOExceptions. It explicitly wraps them in WebSocketExceptions with the error code `ConectionClosedPrematurely`.

Perhaps having a way for a Hub to indicate that it's willing to see even these more ""noisy"" failures is appropriate. For a system like Blazor it makes sense to want to tell the difference here. I think we should've left this error in the `OnDisconnectedAsync` handler instead of suppressing it. Maybe 3.0 can justify changing that behavior but we'd need quite a bit of backup to get that through ask mode."
"@github feel free to correct me if I'm wrong here, but I'm pretty sure the idea is not to change HubMessage.java at all. The idea is to simply change this JsonHubProtocol.writeMessage method to serialize using a JsonWriter and put all the type-specific logic for serializing each HubMessage type to JSON inside of JsonHubProtocol.java itself.

So instead of having an `abstract void write(JsonWriter writer);` implementation on InvocationMessage and calling `message.write(writer)` from JsonHubProtocol.writeMessage, you would have a `if (message instanceof InvocationMessage) { ... } else if (message instanceof ...`. It's less object-oriented, but it will make adding non-JSON protocols like MessagePack easier in the future. Instead of every HubMessage needing to know how to serialize using JsonWriter, MessagePackWriter and whatever else, all the serialization logic stays within the protocol class this way."
"If the server is not caching at all, then it's not problematic. That's one of the benefits of this whole new feature.

If it's doing caching wrong in certain ways (e.g., returning headers to cache for a specific time period regardless of content changes) then there will be trouble but that's also true for all their other static resources, index.html, etc.

The only scenario I had in mind for why `cache: 'no-cache'` would be really beneficial is if, at some point, we support loading these resources from an external CDN. At that point, every site has its own `CacheStorage` but shares the browser's regular HTTP cache. By using `cache: 'no-cache'` you get to re-use the warm HTTP cache to populate a new site's `CacheStorage`.

However I recognize that's not a scenario that actually happens today so it's more ambiguous where the best tradeoff lies. I somewhat prefer keeping `cache: 'no-cache'` so nobody could say we were breaking them later if we changed from `'reload'` to `'no-cache'` in the future when adding CDN support.

Do you feel strongly about this? I'm open to changing it if so. Please ping me to discuss!"

"> Which only overwrittes the synchronous methods to extend the indentation function.

Isn't that the root of the problem?  There are other things wrong with that: it means that even when the underlying text writer robustly supports async operations, any async operations issued against the IndentedTextWriter are going to end up queueing sync operations.

Seems like the right fix is to override the XxAsync methods on IndentedTextWriter appropriately.  That will address both this issue (the overrides can do the right thing with regards to indents) and the async-over-sync issue."

"I'm concerned about the lifetime mechanics of this type.  It contains pointers, so we need to ensure that they're freed, which would imply that it should have a destructor.

OK, so there's a known memory leak here.  It needs fixing.

But *how*?  The *normal* C++ solution would be a ""proper"" constructor, plus destructor, plus assignment operator (plus others?):

```cpp

This *immediately* makes the ""normal"" C++ approach feel ""wrong"", because `memcpy()` knows nothing of destructors.  It's ""probably"" fine, but it *really* makes me side-eye it.

Which is where a `std::vector<InMemoryAssemblyEntry>` starts looking *much* nicer, but as you [mentioned earlier](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/3365#discussion_r316209406) this has complications.

"ok, i checked on things.  we already throw in caes where there is a true invariatn issue.

What's going on here though is that we are resilient to legal things a caller might do.  For example, we may have the persistence service, but the user may just 'new up' a workspace/solution in memory that has no set solution-path.  It's totally legal to call into us, asking us to store data.  In that case we just return 'false' to say ""sorry, we couldn't do it"".  

THe value of this flag is that i'm effectively telling the system: you're in a context where this sort of behavior *of the caller* should be considered a bug.  It's useful when testing things out so that we can distinguish why we get certain results (for example, did we fail to read a stream because we truly didn't have it, or because the input was wrong)."

My proposed names would be 'wrapper_js_handle' for the handle (so it's clear that it's not a handle to the *actual* js function target) and 'wrapper' for the local. We may also need to do a check here of some sort to ensure that the jsobj we got is actually a bound function and not something else, since they appear to live in a global handle namespace and someone writing broken code could accidentally pass the wrong kind of handle to the invoke icall.

"@github 

> Can you elaborate on why this limitation was placed on partial methods previously. Having a small history or the design reasons would be informative.

The feature `partial` methods was originally created to help out designer code generation patterns. Developers wanted to add code at the end of certain designer generated methods like ctos, `InitializeComponent`, etc ... In the early days of generators the only way to do this was to go edit the generated file and add a call into your user defined code. This was really brittle because every time the generator re-ran the added user call would be ""deleted"" because it wasn't a part of the standard code gen. 

Generators could have helped here by emitting a call to a well named method at the end of `InitializeComponent`. However if that method didn't exist it would be a compilation error and a breaking change. 

The `partial` methods feature helps this because it's a conditional hook method. The generator both emits the call to `OnInitializeComponentCompleted` and the `partial` method signature. 

```cs
partial void OnHookCompleted();
```

This is safe to do because if the user doesn't define `OnHookCompleted` then the compiler will just delete the call to it at the end of `OnInitializeCompleted`. Now designer generators can safely emit hook behavior in a completely back compat fashion. 

The `void` restriction exists because the feature specifically allows for the `partial` method invocation to be deleted. If the language allowed non-void return methods then it would allow for scenarios like this:

```cs
partial int SomeMethod();

...
// what is the value of ""i"" if the call to SomeMethod is deleted?
int i = SomeMethod(); 
```

My thinking here is that we could relax the `void` restriction and supplement with a rule essentially like the following:

> partial methods which are non-void returning **must** have an implementation method

That didn't really make sense in the context of the original feature but would make sense in the context of source generators. There the `partial` would just be the template the user is directing the source generator to implement for them. Hence return values make a lot of sense.

Again caveats: take this more as my internal musings vs. actual direction idea. I wasn't on the C# team when `partial` methods were added so I may lack some context. Will bring this up though with others next week to get their opinion on it. 

Note: it's been a while so I'm sure I got a few of the method names wrong. The overall scenario though is correct. "

"> It seems like the HTTP callback is not ready to called multiple times.

This is specific to HttpClientHandler (you're not hitting this when using SocketsHttpHandler directly, right?).  The callback signature from HttpClientHandler expects the HttpRequestMessage to be passed in, so we need to capture the instance into the closure used for the underlying RemoteCertificateValidationCallback so that it can be in turn passed to the handler's ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback.  But as a result of capturing it in that way, the HttpRequestMessage would end up being referenced for the lifetime of the callback, thus keeping it alive and from being garbage collected.  The fix for this issue (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36979) was to null out the field after the callback was invoked (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/37021), with the assumption that it wouldn't be invoked again.  If it is invoked again, then it triggers the assert put in place to validate it wasn't being invoked again.

So, we have a choice to make, either:
1. Ensure the callback is never invoked multiple times.  But it sounds like that's not actually viable, that it's expected to be invoked multiple times in the face of renegotation if the certificate changes.
2. Allow null to be passed instead of the original message on renegotation.  This is in fact what's happening today, and the nullable annotation on the parameter is wrong.  But if we want to accept that, then a) we need to remove the assert, and b) we need to change the first argument of the callback from `HttpRequestMessage` to `HttpRequestMessage?` to signify that it can actually be null, so that callbacks guard against it if they happen to be using the request message.
3. Hold on to the message for the lifetime of the connection in case it may be needed for a subsequent callback invocation, essentially reverting #37021.
4. Expose something on HttpClientHandler to allow this choice to be made by the dev, e.g. exposing AllowRenegotation.  But as it would default to true as is currently the case, this choice alone is likely insufficient.

None of these options seem great, but (2) is probably the best.  @github? (@github, FYI on nullable annotations)"

"What methods specifically do you need optimized? The only one that is likely to regress is `Equals(StringSegment)`, because it's now bouncing through an indirection. But I can hand-tune that if needed.

Reiterating my earlier comment: if this is _really_ in a hot path, seriously consider allowing some behavioral changes here. For instance, the fact that there's special-casing all over the place to distinguish between `default(StringSegment)` and `StringSegment.Empty` leads to unnecessary complexity + slower perf. Allowing the two to be treated as equivalent would optimize things.

Allowing this change in behavior would make existing methods dumb wrappers around the already highly-optimized span versions. For example:

```cs
// Pretty much the whole call stack gets inlined into the caller at this point.
public bool Equals(StringSegment other) => this.AsSpan().SequenceEquals(other.AsSpan());
```"
">  allowing to reference managed-only linux RID-specific implementations that e.g. just p/invoke (which work and we want to have) versus pulling in native .so files for linux that definitely won't just work on android.

Do packages need to provide a different native asset in order to work on android?  If so they can provide that in the `android-arm64` folder.

Do packages need to not provide any native asset to work on android?  If so they can make that happen by adding an empty `android-arm64` folder.  Can't change the package?  Consumers can add `ExcludeAssets=""native""` on the PackageReference.

There's no promise that a package that specializes for a platform will just work on a brand new platform that they've never considered.  RIDs try to do their best to represent useful reuse, so that more often than not folks can avoid duplication when they specialize by platform.  They can't get it right 100% of the time, but when its wrong there should be a way to make a package specialize for the new platform once the author understands it needs to.  We should only be changing RID hierarchy if there is data out there showing that a majority of the time the RID graph leads to duplication rather than reuse."
"@github it looks like I misremembered the behaviour of Windows links.
(Current behaviour) It gets the time on the link file, but sets the time onto the target file (this seems inconsistent to me).
What should the expected behaviour be? I personally feel like it should be both get and set on the link itself (which is what I've implemented for Mac), which would make more sense with the eventual completion of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/projects/41 to me, and also how I'd like to use it in my code.
In my code it looks like I just disabled setting time on links on Windows because it could crash if the target doesn't exist.
I didn't/haven't yet invested time into seeing how to set the time on links using low-level Windows APIs.
Also, it should be noted that my test would pass if the set and get both did either the target or the link itself.
How should we continue @github, should I just add Windows to the ActiveIssue attribute as well as the other failing platforms, or do something else? I'm happy for discussion to be had about what the correct behaviour should be, but personally I need some way to set it on the link itself: whether it's using a different api or not doesn't bother me.
Explanation of my logic with links:
Functions that work with the target (windows afaik): Set times, Reads and writes (it makes sense that it would be this to me)
Functions that work with the link itself (windows afaik): Delete, Exists, Get times, GetAttributes
I'm not sure where other APIs are.
To me it would make sense for all the APIs to work with the link itself, except for reading/writing the content (since link files have no visible content and this is the point of links). With the link API proposed in #24271 one could simply get the target and set attributes (time, attributes, etc.) on the target if they so desired.
Obviously if we're setting it on a file in a symlink folder then it makes sense to do it on the real file.
Also of note: I currently emulate a large portion of the logic in #24271 in one way or another as I wanted to be able to manipulate links, but I couldn't find a different way to do it other than writing interop code myself for Windows, and on Mac I just called the `ln` executable.
Edit: also my test seems to be failing on Mac despite testing it locally, I must have done something wrong locally, I'll fix the test in the next commit.
Edit 2: I don't seem to be able to repro the issues with the test locally yet (specifically SettingUpdatesPropertiesOnSymlink), which is odd. I've confirmed that the dates are set on the link files by pausing it just before the test finishes, not sure what's happening here."

"I recommended it because people often specify the wrong slash when deploying their app cross platform. E.g. developing on windows and deploying to linux. The alt separator still works in most APIs, and is invalid to combine with the primary separator (right?).

"I was wrong with my last comment. Task captures the ExecutionContext when it's constructed so it uses that ExecutionContext rather than the ExecutionContext of the thread it's completed on (thankfully thinking about this more).

This makes me want to return a ConfiguredTaskAwaitable from InitializeConnectionAsync so the entire tests run without the sync context like I thought was happening before, but it doesn't have to be this PR. E.g.

```C#
protected ConfiguredTaskAwaitable InitializeConnectionAsync(RequestDelegate application, int expectedSettingsCount = 3, bool expectedWindowUpdate = true)
{
    return InitializeConnectionInnerAsync(application, expectedSettingsCount, expectedWindowUpdate).DefaultTimeout().ConfigureAwait(false);

It probably does. This, however, doesn't mean that there is something wrong with this comment, or there is something wrong with its placement. This is an existing comment that I intend to keep because it was accurately describing and still accurately describes intent of the code it is associated with.

Sure

I think so; we can just have the delegate return the flush mode that's desired.

If we're not concerned about what might go wrong if the delegate threw an exception (e.g. an OOM), then sure.  It sounds like you're saying that's the case."
That first exclamation mark is completely wrong.

"I would add some sort of note about about this since it's basically a hack to get around the fact we only register images based on the filename. It's quite possible someone is confused by this down the line.

I'd probably also add a note in `mono_image_open_a_lot_parameterized` about the function's lack of awareness of this hack. If you load a satellite image by name for one culture with it and then attempt to load a second culture after, you should get the wrong image. This is not a regression, and I believe is how this has worked for a long time now, but it's the one place we *didn't* fix this."

"There's a ton of work that needs to be done on the conapi interface before we can merge. Other than that, we need to make sure that everything that's currently only implemented in `TerminalDispatch` is also copied across to `AdaptDispatch`. And as I said above, if you're copying functionality from `AdaptDispatch` (like these tabs), it's preferable if the code is essentially identical between the two.

So as long as you're doing that, I don't think there's anything wrong with this PR. I'm just not sure why we actually need the functionality in `TerminalDispatch` at this point. Are we intending to pass these tab sequences through conpty?"
A nit - wrong indentation
It started out with the elipses. Then I swear I saw a different processing pop up without it and thought I had made the wrong choice.
nit: `regRec` is wrong here.
"I'm not sure this is right for unpackaged versions of the Terminal. I might want to tap in @github for this bit, hes a bit more familiar with running the Terminal unpackaged. 

Just looking at my own files, I've only got a `%localAppData%\Microsoft\Windows Terminal`.

"For type declarations like `partial record C ...`, we were relying on `IsPartialMember` returning `true` (didn't investigate how/why), which resulted in same behavior but arguably for the wrong reason.

Yet here we have a `Locating essential tool binaries` *section*, which *isn't* useful.  Then we get to a brief description, but nothing really useful.

(Actually, *every command* prints out this `Locating essential tool binaries` section, which is *useless noise*.  Unless something goes wrong, why do I want to see this?  Why should `xat list` show me the path to `git` or `brew`?)

A month+ later, I'm still not able to remember, understand, or conceptualize the difference between a ""group"" and a ""suite"".  Perhaps different nouns should be used?

I can't quickly see what `xat list -m` *does*, other than emit more blank lines.

I wonder if a concept of ""tags"" would be more useful?  E.g. `AOT_Mono_Android` could have tags `{ aot Mono.Android.dll }`, `AOT_Xamarin_Forms_Performance_Integration` could have tags of `{ aot forms timing }`, etc.?

Is there/should there be a way to *search*/*filter* `xat list` output? `xat list -g`/`xat list -s` does a form of filtering, but -- as per above -- I don't *understand* this difference.

***EXAMPLES***.  The ""Documentation"" -- both in the commit message, and `xat --help`, and `xat run --help`, *everything* needs examples.

I should have read `tools/xat/README.md` first.  Doh.  It still lacks examples.

""test"" is possibly an overused noun.  Consider the `xat run --help` output:

```
% tools/xat/run.sh run --help
…
usage: xat run [OPTIONS]
By default the command runs all the tests.
```

OK, it runs tests.

```
  -g, --group=GROUPS         Run the specified GROUPS. Takes a comma-separated
                               list of test group names or can be repeated on
                               command line
  -s, --suite=SUITES         Run the specified SUITES. Takes a comma-separated
                               list of test suite names or can be repeated on
                               command line
```

what's the relation between these, again?

```
The arguments below use suite-specific format for each entry. 
```

Oh boy.

```
… They are ignored if a test suite runs as part of predefined group:
```

I have no idea what this means. What makes a ""group"" a ""predefined"" group? Why would they be ignored?  Why should they be ignored?  If I do `xat run -g APK_all_tests`, shouldn't `-n`/`-d`/`-a` be applicable?  This header suggests ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

```
  -t, --test=TESTS           Run the specified TESTS. Takes a comma-separated
                               list of test names
```

So run the specified tests.  What happens with `-t` is used in combination with `-g=` or `-s=`? Is it additive? Set intersection?  Other?

```
  -i, --include-categories=CATEGORIES
                             Run tests in the specified CATEGORIES. Takes a
                               comma-separated list of test categories
```

So tests have categories?  (This is presumably the NUnit/xUnit concept of categories?) How does this relate to groups & suites?  *Does* it?  *Should* it?

What *is* `Unit_No_Node`? It doesn't appear to *do* anything:

```
% tools/xat/run.sh run -g Unit_No_Node
… prints out tool paths …
```

Some of the suite names also contain ""duplicative"" strings, and not necessarily in a way that ""conveys meaning"":

  * `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Tests`
  * `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Dynamic_Tests`
  * `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Export_Tests`
  * …

Both ""Java"" and ""Interop"" are repeated twice in each suite name, but what's it *mean*? It needs to be unique, certainly, but why not trim off the `JavaInterop_` prefix?  (Perhaps another place where ""tags"" could be a useful concept?)

I suggested earlier that ""names"" -- not sure if I meant group name or suite name, and I still don't know the difference -- could/should be *filesystem paths*, because then at least I *know* what it corresponds to.  I have no idea what `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Tests` is.  There are *at least two separate projects* for ""`Java.Interop-Tests`"":

  * `external/Java.Interop/tests/Java.Interop-Tests`: Desktop unit tests for `Java.Interop.dll` (in `Java.Interop-Tests.dll`)
  * `tests/Mono.Android-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests`: Unit tests for `Java.Interop.dll` for use within the `Mono.Android-Tests`.

With some thought, I *think* the second one isn't ""applicable"", because it'll be ""included"" in `Mono.Android-Tests`, but this is *thinking* that I don't necessarily want to perform. Reading the source code doesn't immediately help either!

```csharp
{ ""Java.Interop-Tests.dll"",                            Path.Combine (""Java.Interop-Tests"",                            ""Java.Interop-Tests.csproj"") },
```

How many `Java.Interop-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests.csproj` files are there?

```
% find . -iname Java.Interop-Tests.csproj
./tests/Mono.Android-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests.csproj
./external/Java.Interop/tests/Java.Interop-Tests/Java.Interop-Tests.csproj
```

That's right, 2.

In short, the `JavaInterop_Java_Interop_Tests` suite name does me no favors, the ""Host Unit"" name of `JavaInterop: Java.Interop-Tests` doesn't help me, and the *source code* doesn't help me.  The only thing that *might* help, maybe, *if I got it right*, is mental effort to *exclude* one of the tests projects I know of, on the assumption that it's inclusion ""doesn't make sense.""

I'm thinking too hard already. :-(

What *would* be a useful ""grouping"" to me would be ""all AOT tests"".  No such grouping exists.

```
% ./tools/xat/run.sh run -s Mono_Android
…
```

What's the output look like when there's a *failure*?  Examples welcome!

As-is, output is, again, *verbose* (yay?), but not all is necessarily *useful*?

```

"No. There was a huge discussion that was done before July where we had suggested names, and it died in review. I'm going to resurrect it for discussion in 2017 - https://trello.com/c/cZAT7B4h/314-renaming-mobile-xm-4-5-target-frameworks

But we're going to have to do aliases or something in mmp anyway, since all of the names will be wrong (including mobile)."

"This is wrong, you're passing `owns=false` to the `CGPath` constructor: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/blob/caa1e702a9a0bf7e19054aa4c48d0a96aa471979/src/CoreGraphics/CGPath.cs#L105

Which means our `CGPath` binding will retain the handle: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/blob/caa1e702a9a0bf7e19054aa4c48d0a96aa471979/src/CoreGraphics/CGPath.cs#L107-L108

The problem is that `CGPathCreateMutableCopy` already returns a retained handle (Apple's documentation states `You are responsible for releasing this object` [[1]])

The end result is that now we'll leak the returned CGPath.

The correct behavior would be to pass `owns: true`.

"Found another issue with my own PR. Building in debug (how could I have missed that before?) seems to fail :

```
  Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
    ""_xamarin_dyn_objc_msgSendSuper_stret"", referenced from:
       -u command line option
    ""_xamarin_dyn_objc_msgSend_stret"", referenced from:
       -u command line option
    ""_xamarin_dyn_objc_msgSendSuper"", referenced from:
       -u command line option
    ""_xamarin_dyn_objc_msgSend"", referenced from:
       -u command line option
  ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64
```

This is caused by this code in Target.cs :

```
				if (App.Platform == ApplePlatform.MacOSX) {
					has_dyn_msgSend = App.MarshalObjectiveCExceptions != MarshalObjectiveCExceptionMode.Disable && !App.RequiresPInvokeWrappers && Is64Build;
				} else {
					has_dyn_msgSend = App.IsSimulatorBuild;
				}

				if (has_dyn_msgSend) {
					dynamic_symbols.AddFunction (""xamarin_dyn_objc_msgSend"");
					dynamic_symbols.AddFunction (""xamarin_dyn_objc_msgSendSuper"");
					dynamic_symbols.AddFunction (""xamarin_dyn_objc_msgSend_stret"");
					dynamic_symbols.AddFunction (""xamarin_dyn_objc_msgSendSuper_stret"");
				}
```

Those functions are only defined for i386/x86_64. For arm64, the variation without `xamarin_dyn` are also defined. However, we hit a bit of a bind here in the definition of this because it's both required (for the x64 build) and not available (in the arm64 build). From what I understand, on arm64, we don't actually need those functions for things to work, so if I'm not wrong, we should probably refactor the symbol requirement per targeted architectures (so that we pass those symbols when building for x86_64, but not when building for arm64)."
"This looks wrong.

This test file is wrong.

`class C { set X(...v) {} }`, which this file is testing, is invalid syntax. `set` methods, on either classes or objects, only accept exactly one valid `FormalParameter`, which does _not_ allow for `FunctionRestParameter`.

You need to have this message in the resources and not hardcoding it. What was wrong in the original message? It is unlikely now to throw this exception anyway.  #Closed
"can y ou make this to just throw when wrong bool is given?

"Much later: I was wrong. It is called when `node` is a QuestionQuestionToken and `node.parent` is a LogicalAssignmentExpression. From the new test, when node is `x` in `d ??= x ?? ""string""`, and `node.parent` is `??=`.

I guess the deleted line was added because `??=` is a logical expression...but it's also an assignment expression."
"This error seems to be wrong, since `Bar` is `Foo` and thus it has the `#m` property."
"This seems wrong.  The _statement_ of the 'with' block should not be checked, but the _expression_ of the with block should still be checked.  Yes?
"
"> The problem is that the intrinsics doesn't exist for a type of byte since you can't narrow that any further. So using the return type here is wrong.

Are there any issues with encoding the instruction based on the return type, rather than the input type? Is the input type size needed for importation or codegen elsewhere?"
"> So i strongly follow the opinion that exceptions should be exceptional. 

It would indeed be exceptional if the compiler passed us tokens of an unexpected syntax. 

> They should indicate bugs in our code. i.e. if we're just processing data we can't make certain assurances about, that shouldn't be an exception, that should be 'TryXXX'.

Yes, it would be a bug in the IDE code that we are not handling some kind of new token syntax or a bug in the compiler that they are producing some kind of bad tokens. In both cases it's our code!

> That way, when we're wrong about an invariant, things legit crash (possibly caught by a boundary exception layer), and we can get info in a non-crashing way for things we're uncertain about.

OK, now I'm confused. Isn't that what I'm saying?

"@github In https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/src/Analyzers/VisualBasic/Tests/NamingStyles/NamingStylesTests.vb, all VB tests contain a PascalCase module. Not sure what's wrong. Also, I'm not sure how to continue with explicitly supporting ""Module"" in editorconfig."

"> I don't know what this means, but I guess I might need to try again to add the project from Visual Studio.

It just means that the GUID used in the SLN file is incorrect. The line which declares the project , and likely the subsetquent consupmions, use the wrong GUID. "
"Looks like control-flow is wrong as well:

##### Case 1

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97092011-26611700-15f5-11eb-9e63-964dcd5762d0.png)

`y` should be `0` because the default is evaluated before the computed property name. 

##### Case 2
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97092000-03366780-15f5-11eb-9bb3-5610a1dbf46a.png)

Here `y` should be `9` because the default evaluates first.

##### Cases 3 & 4
We also don't seem to narrow when we know the default *won't* be evaluated:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97092073-9a032400-15f5-11eb-99ea-f571fd32d2e1.png)

In both cases above, `y` should be `8` because the default will never be evaluated due to the fact the outer destructured value is a tuple with a  fixed length.

##### Case 5
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97091961-a63ab180-15f4-11eb-9c02-80a1db93755b.png)

In this case `y` should be `0 | 8` because we don't know the length of the outer destructured array, and `0` should be the constituent instead of `1` because of Case 1 (above).

##### Case 6

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3902892/97091977-bbafdb80-15f4-11eb-97d0-bbfcb922b011.png)

This case should probably be considered correct. `y` should be `0 | 8` because we don't know the length of the outer destructured array.

Moving Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms and Microsoft.NETCore.Targets  to csproj so that we can directly add project references to these csprojs. 
This will also correct the assets.json file which is currently missing this dependencies or contains the wrong version.
This will further help in pack task in calculating dependencies. Currently this is done on the dynamically in a target.
We can utilize this to use the live version of these projects in the installer as well.

"> The x86 failure looks like a bug exposed by this change, it is probably not caused by this. We should open an issue about it/disable the test in this PR and merge it before the feature complete.

actually, I was wrong, it is the issue in this change because one `size>0` condition was dropped, so now we are failing with assert on such tree:

sounds like we should have deleted that tree during importation:

but we did not, maybe because it has to throw when the address is null?

In the original code if there were scanner issues False was returned and there was a single error message that listed all the ways your code might be wrong but it was not specific. Here if we are in the new code we never return an errors to a higher level to deal with. We parse the code, decide that we are in new code and then if we find an error we add the diagnostic with specific new message about what is wrong. This has the advantage that we didn't have to retest everything (it was @github  idea)."

> if you know 2 are same thing. what confuse you? 

You are referencing what should be the same thing through entirely different paths of poperties/expressions.  That is fundamentally confusing.  It makes the code harder to read and understand.

The person reading the code now has to go: wait... i thought these wer ethe same... are they not?  Why is the code referencing it in different ways.

And, because there is no comment, one now has to go: ""is this intentional?  would it be subtly wrong if to switch one to use the same expression as the other?""

This sort of coding is brittle and leads to difficulty with maintaining things.  it should be avoided, especially around exceptionally subtle stuff like cancellation/threading.

In any case, there is a syntax explicitly declaring the constructor - at least the parameter list. There is also other user code in it - base arguments. Likely there will be a body in the future as well. Even today we should fire analyzers actions for the constructor, due to presence of user code. Analyzer driver filters out implicitly declared symbols all over the code. The work to get analyzer actions fired as appropriate is on the books.

"There are really 3 options for what to do if a mutating request fails:
1. Throw away the mutations and hope for the best (which is what this code is doing)
2. Apply the mutation and hope for the best

I don't have a strong feeling either way really, as I think 1 and 2 both have an equal chance of resulting in a solution state in memory that doesn't match what the user is seeing, but I went with 1 because I am working on the theory that people will be more likely to understand if the server seems to be ""lagging"" the state they're seeing, and try reconnecting or re-opening the document.

"Hokay, so I _think_ I've got it re-expanding the list of commands each time the list of tabs changes, and I don't think it's noticable. 

I hate it, because it involves having `TerminalPage` _make a copy_ of the commands from `CascadiaSettings`, then expand that copy, every time the list of tabs changes. But on the bright side, `CascadiaSettings` won't need to know anything about the list of tabs when the expansion happens. `CascadiaSettings` would only keep the original blob of commands around, and they'd _need_ to be expanded before the palette could use them. This seems not horrible.

The copying is going to be more annoying when the map of commands isn't just an `unordered_map`. We'd need to be able to clone the original `winrt::...Map` into a new one, then expand the commands using only methods that are exposed by the _projection_. Assuming that we want to have `ExpandCommands` eventually take a list of the current tabs, this means that the projected `ExpandCommands` would either need to:
* be implemented in `Microsoft::Terminal::Settings::Command`, and accept a `TerminalApp::Tabs`. This would be a layering violation. 
  - We could work around this by having our tabs expose something dumb like `Terminal::Settings::ITabInformation` and have `ExpandCommands` accept that instead.
    - this is the solution I'd be _least_ opposed to
* be implemented in `TerminalApp`, but then we wouldn't be able to inspect the implementation details of `Command`, which means we wouldn't be able to easily access the original json used for the command (which we need to be able to expand the command).
  - we could do something extra dumb like exposing the original json as a projected method on `Command`, but that's definitely silly

So I've pushed just this change to [`dev/migrie/f/6856-let-terminalpage-expandcommands`](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/compare/dev/migrie/f/command-palette-iterateOn...dev/migrie/f/6856-let-terminalpage-expandcommands?expand=1).

"@github has mentioned in the past that the latest Textmate grammars are scraped roughly once a month, so—correct me if I'm wrong, Alex—I believe no action is needed to get the upstream changes from Rust Syntax merged.  In the interim, you can use the Rust Syntax extension, which should play nicely with Rust Analyzer now that RA is not shipping a grammar. The Textmate scopes will only be visible with `""[rust]"": { ""editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled"": false }` in your `settings.json`, otherwise RA will override with semantic scopes.

Regarding #64488, I think it should probably be closed at this point. The grammar still needs minor improvements—which I am working on—but the essence of the issue has been fixed. In truth, most serious Rustaceans are using semantic highlighting via Rust Analyzer, but the current grammar provides reasonable default VS Code highlighting."
"After looking at it for a while, I think it's not worth it. We calculate the minimum size of each pane (and snap it to the text buffer grid) using pixels. We could probably rewrite all of that to just create a ratio. But that's risky and not really worth it.

Also, I could be wrong about this, but I'd imagine it's not a huge perf impact anyways."
"I'm slightly concerned about this, because synthesized code can contain explicit conversions, and NullableWalker can take such conversions and try to re-classify them, passing its `ExplicitCastInCode` value to `ClassifyConversion`'s `forCast` argument (indirectly). Then Conversions will say that the conversion doesn't exist. Wrong information could be propagated out, or unwanted diagnostics given. See #51631.

Basically, it's a rather small corner case, but I think if `ExplicitCastInCode` *requires* that a cast is present in user syntax, we may want a follow up item to make sure the NullableWalker avoids using it as an argument to `NullableWalker.GenerateConversion`, and to make sure that synthesized code never passes a 'true' value for this flag. Possibly with `Debug.Assert(!(WasCompilerGenerated && ExplicitCastInCode))` when creating a BoundConversion or something like that.

"@github good question :)

They are very common but _usually_ `bgen` (the binding generator) generates them for you (on every ObjC bindings), e.g. look into generated `src/build/ios/native/AVAsset.g.cs` and you see many lines like this one:

```csharp
[BindingImpl (BindingImplOptions.GeneratedCode | BindingImplOptions.Optimizable)]
```

This tells other tools (like the managed linker) that it was generated code (so we know how it looks in IL) and that it is safe to be optimized.

Some C-based API (like this one) are using _ObjC_ blocks (not C-function-based) callbacks (which are much easier to bind). Those API are bound manually (not using `bgen`) but `mtouch` still knows how to optimize them (because that block logic is identical with ObjC ones). In such case we _hint_ our tools that the code can be optimized by adding the attribute manually (obviously we don't pretend it's `GeneratedCode`, just `Optimizable`).

Finally our test suite do run tests with optimization enabled (so it's tested under both normal and optimized paths) and also detect if we have code that linker cannot remove (because some code lack the attribute to optimize them). IOW it's hard to get wrong and forget them :)"

Maybe DotNetExports is the wrong name for this if 'createDotnetRuntime' is the only public export from dotnet.js? If the parameter name is 'api' maybe it's DotNetPublicAPI or something
"Using sequential layout turned out to be the easiest way to enforce that enum types get the right alignment (with auto layout, 8-byte enums were getting the wrong alignment on x86)"
"The combinations of the testcases are really good. It would be nice if the asserts fall into its own testcase. This way, when something fails, there is just one scenario that is at fault and we dont want to be looking at which assert, among the 4, that failed the whole testcase.

Also a different name instead of `expected00` would be more readable. In this case, it would be something like `expectedWithNoSpaceBeforeCommaAndAfterComma`. When this particular assert fails, the user will automatically know what the expectation is instead of trying to understand the naming convention and finding out what went wrong. Descriptive variable names are always preferred over cryptic names
"
"IMO, it makes sense to put the error where the code is likely wrong. In this case, the code is wrong to attempt to call or construct the thing, but that might be because it's the wrong thing (not because the calling or constructing of the thing is wrong); so we don't really know if the issue is because the import is wrong or because the usage is wrong, but we'd like to provide some hints as to how to fix it in either case."
"It's possible that there are multiple symlinks to the same module, although it's not technically *wrong* to use one or the other since it works either way; we could iterate over all known symlinks though and take the best, would that be better?"
"> btw. this looks wrong in the existing native/libs code since we use cmakedefine01 for it too: 

Yes, we should fix that too."
"Here's how far I got:
```ts
export function areCompilerOptionsEqual(option: CommandLineOption, a: unknown, b: unknown) {
    switch (option.type) {
        case ""boolean"":
        case ""number"":
        case ""string"":
            return a === b;
        case ""list"":
            return arraysEqual(a as unknown[], b as unknown[], (aa, bb) => areCompilerOptionsEqual((option as CommandLineOptionOfListType).element, aa, bb));
        case ""object"":
            return equalOwnProperties(a as MapLike<unknown>, b as MapLike<unknown>, isJsonEqual);
        default:
            something with maps;
    }
}
```
Doesn't seem worth it since I need to call `isJsonEqual` in the nested case anyway, and I need some casts which might not be valid if someone put a wrong value in their tsconfig."
"I don't think this is right - checking is `any` prop in the indexed access's type is optional and then returning `never` for its type if so seems very wrong - the potential type of the LHS is completely lost here, and it loses the nuance of the individual property accessed. This needs #29317 to be correctly solved - the LHS type should be `leftType & not 0 & not null & not undefined & not """"`, which handles generics appropriately."
"Or, let me ask a more specific question about `permissiveMapper` and the error scenarios you mentioned—what would be the consequences of, rather than early returning the input `type`, just proceeding to return the reverse mapped type with an instantiated source, but with `mappedType` and `constraintType` simply copied:

```ts
function instantiateReverseMappedType(type: ReverseMappedType, mapper: TypeMapper) {
     return inferTypeForHomomorphicMappedType(
         instantiateType(type.source, mapper),
         type.mappedType,
         type.constraintType
     ) || type;
}
```

I think this would have been my instinct, and I don’t understand what would go wrong, in what cases."
"@github thanks for this..I missed it. @github owns this area perhaps he can review it. It looks like your change matches what I suggests.

Btw if MSDN docs are wrong perhaps you could offer a PR for that in their repo? "
"@github/roslyn-compiler I need some help with this PR.  I've made a change on the IDE side to call some public methods on a Compilation after we create it.  Specifically: `compilation.Assembly` and `compilation.GetAssemblyOrModule(ref)` here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/43207/files#diff-a49d90e995e113586d4d5701395914d2R118

However, these calls now cause a *crash* *inside* the compiler during some integration tests.  Specifically, i get a crash here:

<details>

   at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.FailFast.OnFatalException(System.Exception)
```

</details>

The specific crash is here:

```
            var expandedNamespace = expandedGlobalNamespace;
            for (int i = nameParts.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            {
                // Note, the name may have become ambiguous (e.g. if a type with the same name
                // is now in scope), but we're not rebinding - we're just expanding to the
                // current contents of the same namespace.
                expandedNamespace = expandedNamespace.GetMembers(nameParts[i]).OfType<NamespaceSymbol>().Single();
            }
```

Which is because `GetMembers(""System"")` returns zero items.

I've only been able to get this to crash in integreation tests like CSharpInteractive.BclConsoleCall.  I've really tried spelunking into the code here, but it all relates to things in the ReferenceManager and involve deep state manipulation in the core compilaiton/assembly that i really don't understand.  

Because this is repro'ing in interactive scenarios, my guess is that something in the compiler responsible for setting up symbols with submission-compilations is going wrong, and ends up with invalid internal state.  Unfortunately there are just so many parts to this in that layer that i have no idea what the actual problem is or where it starts from.

I would very much appreciate if i could get help with someone knowledgeable here about what is going wrong in the compiler that is causing a crash.  @github @github/roslyn-compiler who is a good source for info on Assembly-symbols, ReferenceManager and interactive?  Thanks!

"Yep, I got it backwards. `never` is wrong.

We're trying to prevent both reads and writes of the variable since it's only there so Closure can have a name for the associated type alias. I think an error on value-space usage of the variable is better than changing the type, plus suppression of the implicit any error."
"I'm not sure if there's a single bug for razor. The fix is to unify the design time and build time experiences, until they do that they need to be able to compare in the way that they're doing to achieve any sort of perf.

Agree we shouldn't encourage it, but my point was with this approach a broken comparer produces correct code slowly, rather than wrong code quickly. "
"I've added tests, but they might be in the wrong place 😅 "
"> it looks the doc is wrong and this parameter is always out parameter

I think that comment is outdated.  The parameter is marked as in/out and it is used when the MUI_ALL_LANGUAGES flag is passed (which we do not pass)."
"> I would expect that conflict resolution would trim out the first pdb in favor of the second as that one comes via the runtime pack.

Conflict resolution doesn't look at ProjectReference output https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/2674.  This is related.  It looks like RAR is the one discovering the PDB:
```
Primary reference ""System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe, Version=6.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a"".
    Resolved file path is ""/__w/1/s/artifacts/bin/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/net6.0-Release/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll"".
    Reference found at search path location ""/__w/1/s/artifacts/bin/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/net6.0-Release/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll"".
    Found related file ""/__w/1/s/artifacts/bin/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe/net6.0-Release/System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.pdb"".
    The ImageRuntimeVersion for this reference is """".
```
Then it gets added to `ReferenceCopyLocalPaths` along with the DLL since it comes from a ProjectReference, however `ReferenceCopyLocalPaths` was already conflict resolved by `_HandlePackageFileConflicts` *before* RAR, so it does not remove this .  Later on `_HandlePackageFileConflictsForPublish` runs but for some reason it looks like this isn't considering `ReferenceCopyLocalPaths`.  That seems wrong, since it used to handle this https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/84706598659a625b1ffaaea6665f22f4ce789433/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/build/Microsoft.NET.Publish.targets#L229

The binlog shows the `_ComputeResolvedCopyLocalPublishAssets` target running *after* `_HandlePackageFileConflictsForPublish` and appending to the input to conflict resolution `_ResolvedCopyLocalPublishAssets`.  This is a bug.  Conflict resolution should be seeing all the files that get copied to the output in order to do its job.  I think something is broken in the Target sequencing that is causing `_ComputeResolvedCopyLocalPublishAssets` to run after `_HandlePackageFileConflictsForPublish`, I see the same thing happening in a normal file-new-project-app.  @github 

"
"Ah, well, that was dumb. Hooray unit tests."
"First, a preface: I am by no means experienced with JIT dumps. But I took a stab at looking at a JIT dump of this pattern:

```C#
using System;

Console.WriteLine(new FooImpl().Bar());

interface IMarker {}

public abstract class FooBase {
    public virtual int Bar()
    {
        if (this is IMarker)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""marker"");
            return 1;
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""no marker"");
            return 1;
        }
    }
}

public sealed class FooImpl : FooBase, IMarker
{
}
```

At least on macOS ARM, I don't see the `this is IMarker` check get elided. It ends up as a helper call to `CORINFO_HELP_ISINSTANCEOFINTERFACE`.

```
IN0001: 00000C                    ldr     x1, [fp,#24]
IN0002: 000010                    movz    x0, #0xa600
IN0003: 000014                    movk    x0, #0x80e9 LSL #16
IN0004: 000018                    movk    x0, #2 LSL #32
IN0005: 00001C                    bl      CORINFO_HELP_ISINSTANCEOFINTERFACE
etc
```

I'm not sure how much we care, but it was a fun exercise.

@github I am marking this as ""ready"", but if we want to go back to overrides because we end up with interface checks, or if we can figure out how my testing was wrong, I am happy to adjust."

I'd say taking dependency on that behavior was wrong... Let's make it consistent and predictable

A more canonical representation of this would be to declare the ldap_init call to return a SafeConnectionHandle (instead of IntPtr) and the caller should do

```

// In LdapPal.Windows.cs

"I am not sure this is really much more complex when all is said and done, but I understand the concern.  

This is already parsing for `{@github}` so this is simply adding conditions to that same parsing which should not add much overhead unless it gets a match. Also, does this not only run on the `previewer.ts` context which would always get benefit from these changes?  Any time rendering preview hovers with markdown this would be useful and relative linking should be a benefit to all files and content regardless if they are Typescript.

The only real thing this adds would be beneficial 100% of the time in that case.  The parsing fixes `[](file://./)` linking and `file://./` linking in the markdown text.  Those are not Typescript-specific.

You should probably not support linking at all if it doesn't really work.  At least just ignore relative urls as well as {@github} because:

1. @github will never work when cmd+clicking them if they have a label since it will try to open the wrong url but in the hover it will be correct, which means the behavior is not only inconsistent but broken.
    - Another option is to not support the `|` syntax at all for link and just have the `{@github url this is the text}` which this PR does make work.
    - Only supporting `{@github https://www.google.com Google}` syntax also resolves the issue brought up in `contrib/links/links`. Only the fixes to allow `../` style relative linking would be needed there then.
2. relative urls will only work in some case, but not most such as `../` or when rendered from another path in the project.
3. file:// urls also do not work currently when relative and using @github 
4. file:// urls will never work when using markdown `[test](file://./plugins.ts)`
5. file:// urls will never work with fragments - which this does not really make more complex to support `file://./plugins.ts#3,6`

Probably should just remove relative link support completely so-as not to cause problems since at the moment it will fail almost 100% of the time."

"Thank youf again for working on this. 
I'm sorry for adding even more confusion, but I don't think we should fix it like this.
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but the most common scenario during the transfer of baggage is something like this:
```CSharp
foreach (var item in baggage)
{
    activity.AddBaggage(item.Name, item.Value);
}
``` 
Here a sample of how Kestrel doing this: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/c97a0020d8bab6d895bf821f6e47ee8722aa17d5/src/Hosting/Hosting/src/Internal/HostingApplicationDiagnostics.cs#L276

This means that with this change if before the transfer we had baggage like this
```
Key1=NewValue;Key1=OldValue
```
After transfer that would be:
```
Key1=OldValue;Key1=NewValue
```
So the result of `GetBaggageItem` will be changing on each transfer and would be totally unpredictable (Or we would need to require reversal of the baggage collection before adding that is very unintuitive)

This is what actually happening now in net core 3.1 and at lease from my point of view it's better to have a change in behavior then changes in order between transfers.

Alternatively, you could change `GetBaggageItem` method itself to return the last item with that key in the list, but that would mean fully iterating over the list each time (or making list double-linked), so I'm not sure if it worth it.

I do know how complicated is the process of exposing new public method is for your team, but in terms of our use case having something like `SetBaggageItem()` or `RemoveBaggageItem()` would solved all of the problems and it would've allowed to avoid all of the problematic cases discassed here. I don't think somebody actually want's two items with the same key (or if they do they could work with `Baggage` enumeration), but it's quite posible and easy to call `Add` twice in diffirent places or have the need to update value. 

Having the ability to update the list, you could always suggest people use it instead of `Add` when they are facing simular problems and it will prevernt inceasing baggage size when it's not needed."

">ContainingType [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=18&length=14)

it looks like I was wrong and we shouldn't recurse into the containing type here given that base implementation doesn't do that. There is also an explicit comment about that there:
```
            // When we are binding a name with a nested type, Goo.Bar, then we ask for
            // use-site errors to be reported on both Goo and Goo.Bar. Therefore we should
            // not recurse into the containing type here; doing so will result in errors
            // being reported twice if Goo is bad.
``` #Closed"
"add `[DisableDefaultCtor]` here since
* it's not used anywhere;
* the base type is abstract without an `init`
* we can remove it (it's not a breaking change) if we're wrong"
"I wrote that rule :)  A diagnostic means that the tree is not valid in some fashion.  Indeed, that's precisely what the incremental parser uses to make this determination.  So the presence of a diagnostic saying ""you're using the wrong lang version"" ends up impacting all higher up versions which then interpret this as ""there is a problem fitting the text to the syntax model"".  

In this case this is purely a semantic check.  The tree is 100% syntactically valid (definitionally so), but there is an ambient external check that impacts it (specifically the idea of a lang-version).  This also violates the other syntactic rule i specified which is:

> The parser should, as much as possible, be context-free. 

this makes parsing not context free.  In order to parse you have to pass additional context in as it affects the nodes that you might produce.  This also means that if you change compiler, you have to reparse everything (which really doesn't make much sense since the text is all the same, and as such the syntactic structure is truly the same).

Where we have bent this a bit is with record-parsing, where there truly is a different in syntactic structure produced based on options.  But outside of that, where we generate teh same trees otherwise, putting version diagnostics in the parser violates these design principles. "

"Finding ""Task"" when someone writes ""ContinueWith"" is akin to us finding types like `List<T>` when the user types ""foo.Count"".  I think it could be hugely useful.  But it needs to be done properly.  i.e. we should actually be finding types that contain that member and not just saying ""i'm _somewhere deep in an await_ ergo, my type is the same as the contextual type the await would find"".   

To be clear:

`string s = await Foo().ContinueWith(list => list.Count.ToString())`

It is simply wrong for us to say that ""Foo()"" is a `Task<string>`.  The only reason this was ok in the test was because the test was contrived.  It happened to be ok in this one case.  But htat's like saying:   ""string s = x.y.z.Florb()"" and saying that x, y, or z should have the ""string"" type.  It's just taking a type we see and drawing a very erroneous conclusion about it.

Similarly, if you had ""if (a.b)"" then ""b"" should have type 'bool', but 'a' should have nothing inferred about it**.

Up until #643 was ""fixed"" teh type inference service operated in a very considered and careful manner.  It infers types when there is a genuine connection between things.  i.e. if i have ""string s = a.b.c"" then ""c"" def can be inferred to have the ""string"" type.  similarly ""string s = await foo"" or ""string s = await foo.ConfigureAwait()"".  in both these cases 'foo' can be inferred to have type string.  

## 

*\* in the future it would be nifty to say ""try to find a type that has a 'b' on it, and pick something suitable"".  Until then though, i don't want this bad inference code in the type inferrer.

"@github I now fixed all failing tests. By unifying the file banner parsing (relies only on `SyntaxFacts.GetFileBanner` now), I needed to find a middle ground in keeping existing behavior, fixing bugs, dropping features, and unifying behavior (this lead to a lot of changes, so the PR also contains lot's of refactorings of the existing code now, which makes it hard to review).

The most notable change I have done so far is the changes to `AbstractSyntaxFacts.GetFileBanner`. I essentially added support for leading whitespace, end of line, and preprocessor directives (e.g. to support `#region header` around the banner). This method was used by a bunch of other analyzers/fixers (see https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/49440#issuecomment-731590060). I needed to fix one test case after the change in `MisplacedUsingDirectivesInCompilationUnitCodeFixProviderTests`, but I think the behavior was wrong before and is right now.

Most adoptions to the new behavior in FileHeaderTests are also improvements IMO. I needed to drop support for block comments with missing end token, though.

`AbstractFileHeaderHelper` is only a shadow of its former self. I think it can be completely inlined now. What do you think about that?

What should we do with respect file banners in the editorconfig in XML doc comment style? Should those be allowed or should these be treated as text (editorconfig: `/// Some xml doc comment`  -> `// /// Some xml doc comment`)?

I still have to write some more tests, but a review of the current changes would be appreciated."
"@github @github There are actually several issues being debated here:
- Circularities occurring because we're more eager than we need to when _resolving_ (as opposed to _checking_) the type of an expression. As Jason points out, that's not a new issue. We could make progress on this issue by making a distinction between _resolving_ and _checking_ an expression, and only evaluate as much as we need to when resolving. Indeed, we could solve the actual cases in the compiler by doing this for type assertion expressions.
- Inability for symbols to have evolving _declared_ types. This one is much harder. I really don't want to go there unless we absolutely have to.
- Compute _narrowed_ types by iterating to a fixed point. We only do this in limited form today and, as Wes' example shows, we may need to do more here. I'm not super concerned with crazy examples that walk up a ladder of overloads, but I can indeed imagine real world examples where it occurs without overloading. Although I haven't actually seen any in the wild yet. I will continue to think about this issue.

"Ok, here's another oddity -- doesn't explain what goes wrong above, but does suggest why this method may be a fairly stressful case. 

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/6072e4d3a7a2a1493f514cdf4be75a3d56580e84/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Numerics/Matrix4x4.cs#L1329-L1343

We really should not be crossgenning an `SseImpl` method for arm64 as it can never be called on that platform, and the method assumes SSE support. But we do anyways. Because we're compiling this SSE method for arm64 most of the basic inlines fail as the inliner sees these methods will throw:
```
**************** Inline Tree
Inlines into 06001C4B System.Numerics.Matrix4x4:<Invert>g__SseImpl|59_0(System.Numerics.Matrix4x4,byref):bool
  [0 IL=0008 TR=000005 06003F53] [FAILED: does not return] System.Runtime.Intrinsics.X86.Sse:LoadVector128(long):System.Runtime.Intrinsics.Vector128`1[Single]

...
```
Currently, failed ""does not return"" inline methods don't result in control flow dead ends . So these all look like normal calls in the root method that might return. As a result we have a ton of call-crossing vector lifetimes and are giving the upper save/restore logic a good workout.

I don't know yet if crossgenning this method is an artifact of running cross crossgen (that is, I am running a crossgen hosted on x64 here) or a ""feature"".

I wonder if the `SseImpl` version should have another `IsSupported` check guarding some sort of not supported on this platform throw...?

"That depends on the relationship between the `outDir` of the importing file and the `outDir` of the imported file. Consider this non-monorepo project references scenario:

```
src/
  a/
    tsconfig.json - outDir: ../../out/a
    index.ts
  b/
    tsconfig.json - outDir: ../../out/b
    index.ts

out/
  a/
    index.js
    index.d.ts
  b/
    index.js
    index.d.ts
```

Because the `outDir`s of the two projects have the same relationship as the `rootDir`s, it’s safe and conventional to write imports from `a` to `b` as `import { B } from ""../b"";`. But as of #37482, you get two suggestions:

I can’t see any reason why you would ever want the latter. It’s not wrong on disk now, but what happens if you use `out` as the context for a Docker build, copying files to a container image? That image will be broken unless the working directory on the container is also named `out`. These module specifiers aren’t portable."

I think that was also the case before this PR.  It doesn't hit the limit in 4.2 or 4.3 (or probably 4.4, though I didn't confirm), but it's possible that a depth limit is the correct outcome - maybe we used to silently do the wrong thing.  Since my repro is all hacked up, I think performance on the repro from #44851 is way more important.

"It is not functionally wrong to do this, even if there was a concatenation, because we remove it again in the lowering of the coalescing operator. I noticed this technique is used in lot's of places. (For example, the lowering of a non-binary string concatenation builds lot's of intermediary structures that are broken down again when lowering a higher level.) So I used the same technique here to clean up the code considerably. Also, notice that the unit tests all still pass, nothing has changed there.

"you say it's a workaround for a bug here: `// workaround for the bug`

Sure.  Though it would be good to just fix both now since hte bug reports are about the crash:

"The only time SkipValue can fail is when the content is corrupt and moving forward again would not succeed.

It should generally be true that calling the wrong read method does not corrupt the reader (or, if you prefer, any wrong read call utterly destroys the reader).

So either this should avoid advancing at all until the end (which probably requires passing some offsets into some helpers that previously didn't need them), or the body should be something like

"> Does this change cause some expressions that used to be considered constant to no longer be considered constant?

Not really. We wouldn't get here if an expression was considered a constant. See the comment right below ```Case BoundKind.BinaryOperator``` and, based on review of the algorithm, I think it is accurate. Given that, unless there is a bug similar to the one I am fixing, an error is going to be reported anyway. What we could end up with before is that, despite an error, a ```ConstantValue``` for a left operand of a binary operator could be returned. That value, clearly, doesn't represent the result of a binary operator itself and perhaps could have wrong type. That probably could affect what our internal structures hold and the constant value that SemanticModel or a symbol reports, but I do not consider that a breaking change. Compiler simply becomes more ""accurate"" in error scenarios.

"Is this properly named, and/or what are the semantics *supposed* to be?

But that's not what this function does.  It gets a path *rooted in `base_dir`*, and does nothing with `.apk` files.

Other idea: maybe all terminals could inherit from `LiveText`, but we `stopMonitoring` and unregister for `textChange` once we get a UIA notification?

3. But my return type is a string literal union, so why not just return another string? It's going to be checked precisely anyway. And it'll be slightly more efficient and explicit.

As you are adding public API into CoreCLR specific implementation you need to add same public API to Mono's specific System.Private.CoreLib -- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/mono/netcore/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/GC.Mono.cs.

"> Do we agree that the test is definitely wrong?

Not sure.  There are plenty of situations where one disposable type wrapping another disposable type doesn't do anything in its Dispose except call Dispose on the wrapped instance, and Dispose is idempotent, so it's acceptable use.  There are also cases where objects are ref counted, e.g. with SafeHandle, and the wrapper would have taken a ref on the wrapped thing such that disposing the wrapped thing wouldn't have actually closed the wrapped thing until after everything was disposed and released ref counts.  I don't know what category these fall into nor what guarantees we've made in docs... but it seems like this works on Windows?

> if it's possible for libgdiplus to detect that it's being used incorrectly

My confusion is that the APIs being used here are managed.  Misuse of a managed API shouldn't cause a seg fault / crash.  If it's actually misuse, worst case it should throw an exception.  e.g. if I misuse FileStream, it shouldn't crash the process (even though FileStream P/Invokes as an implementation detail), worst case a use-after-dispose would produce an ObjectDisposedException.  So I'm trying to understand what makes this special; it's possible there some aspect of this I'm just missing that makes it different :)"
"@github Can you take another look? One important question for the TODO comments is ""Are there any problems if some options are removed from AutomationObject?""

I can't think of any backcompat issues, while this comment mentions otherwise:

The `AvoidRestoreCycleOnSelfReference` workaround was causing
DiagnosticSource to get the wrong PackageID in the assets file when
referenced by other projects.  This wasn't a problem when using pkgproj
since we'd calculate dependencies from assembly references, ignoring
the assets file.  This is a problem now that we're using csproj pack,
since that gets dependencies from the assets file.

Fixes #52459

If you zip them up to Mono.framework.zip, we can implement logic to handle that at build time and extract the framework."
I'm pretty sure the point of the `if` was not to inline the `ThrowHelper` itself since that's supposed to be a cold path. Was the condition at wrong place?
"@github thank you for providing the details.
@github let me give you some more info on the ""this"" pointer alignment issue. We have an in-memory data structure that's loaded from disk or generated. Items of the problematic type are correctly aligned, however when we are computing an address of such an element, we were using an unaligned pointer and then aligning it. We are walking that in-memory structure and locating elements in there. When we move past the previous element, we can get an unaligned pointer for some previous element's size. What we were doing wrong was that we have first cast the pointer to a data structure that needs 8 byte alignment and then called its member method that aligned ""this"" and returned the aligned result for further use. With this fix, we align the pointer (which is a BYTE*) first and then cast it to the specific type that needs the alignment."
"There is really something wrong with the EH in this test. The EH gets into an infinite loop, so there is something subtle that I must have missed. "
"This seems to be the wrong approach. During `genFnProlog` we scan for on-frame locals that will require tracked reporting, and explicitly exclude dependently promoted structs. However, we keep track of these locals by a pair of frame offsets.

So evidently something goes wrong here (perhaps just with OSR) and we get this range wrong, or are not properly ordering the frame so that we're intermingling locals improperly or something. Continuing to investigate."

"Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like as long as any 'fix' is present, we're returning 'ErrorFix' as one of the categories with applicable actions.

Based on the mappings in the IDE :
- ErrorFix is of higher precedence than CodeFix
- ErrorFix maps to the 'error' lightbulb icon
- CodeFix maps to the 'default' lightbulb icon

Therefore, if 1 or more fixes are applicable, the error lightbulb icon will always be displayed on mouse hover over squiggle, or on set caret position.

The thing to keep in mind is that the lightbulb API 1) calls GetSuggestedActionCategoriesAsync(), picks the category of highest precedence, and then displays the icon for that category. On lightbulb expansion with Ctrl+. however the lightbulb displays the icon for the highest precedence category name in the list of SuggestedActionsSets."
"If possible, this should be backported to 2.1 and 2.2 as soon as possible. It pottentially can cause serious issues to existing applications with wrong impersonation."
"We have an application which works with different servers using some protocol X. End users are interested in working with the only server at the same time. Usually the user doesn’t even have an access to several servers. So some users work with server1, other users work with server2, etc.

On the app side we have a health check to monitor the state of each server. The server server1 might be Healthy, server2 - Unhealthy and server3 - Degraded. It is absolutely okay because we don’t control the servers (they are external third party resources). Some of them are actually just demo servers so that they are often down. We also have an application-wide check to monitor the app itself. There we check the things which are not related to the servers directly, e.g. databases on our side. But we also include the servers to that app-wide check so that if all the servers are Unhealthy, then the app is Unhealthy too because we don’t expect such situation and most probably something is wrong on the app side. Anyway, even if everything is fine with the service itself we still want a notification that nobody is able to use the service. But the thing is that the default logic results Unhealthy when at least one check (e.g. server2) is Unhealthy.

Eventually, we use a workaround which works normal enough. I don’t think that our specific case is enough reason to change the framework behavior. I just found that kind of flexibility useful for the community. I can imagine some other calculation logic in other apps. That’s why I created the PR."

comment wrong?
"I see how I caused this confusion by wrongly naming SignedSatQ(SignedWideType val, out UnsignedNarrowType result) instead of UnsignedSatQ. The underlying implementation was correct, so the tests passed - the helper name was wrong :-)

In fact, I found that we only need the following three helpers:
- SignedSatQ(SignedWideType val, out SignedNarrowType result)
- UnsignedSatQ(SignedWideType val, out UnsignedNarrowType result)
- UnsignedSatQ(UnsignedWideType val, out UnsignedNarrowType result)

I added SatQ helper as defined in the Arm specification and used it instead of SignedSatQ/UnsignedSatQ to make the implementation looks closer to the *""gold standard""*.

However, since we decided to provide right logical shifts overloads for signed types - I had to extend SatQ helper operating on signed arguments in the way allowing reinterpretation of the incoming signed values as unsigned that helps avoiding doing multiple casting in different helpers.

I pushed the change to Helpers.tt Helpers.cs - it makes sense to look at the former only."

The pattern of `property.GetOwnOrInheritedGetMethod()?.ReturnTypeFlowAnalysisAnnotations ?? FlowAnalysisAnnotations.None` seems like it's repeated a bit in our code. It's here now as well as being inside of `SymbolExtensions.GetFlowAnalysisAnnotations`. Why do we not just have this as a property on `PropertySymbol` as we do for `MethodSymbol`?

"I still find my approach in #52189 more suitable. Why do you ignore the hard acquired `containerSymbol` just to do the same work here again (and facing the same problems)?

(Note: Doing `var container = containerSymbol.GetSymbolType();` for unnamed symbols works pretty well in #52189)

Do I miss something? Is there something wrong about the `containerSymbol` that prevents it from being re-used here?

Just my two cents."

OK we all discussed this with Teams. I'm willing to concede this point because Hyperlinks are so interesting here that they push the boundaries of this sort of unified model.

Do what?  How do you know what went wrong and what to do differently next time / how to fix it so it doesn't happen again?

> With no retry policy/error handler callback/etc, the method feels, to me, too trivial to be worth adding if it throws on the first failure (except for a few degenerate cases, like ""your destination is an illegal path"").

I agree with that.  I also think it's not worth adding if it only does some of what you asked it to do and happily returns false with no additional information.  If we want to throw an exception after it's completed copying whatever it can, that's fine; the API review discussed either throwing the first exception or the last exception or an aggregate... any of those seems better than returning false (though with an aggregate I'd worry about memory impact if lots of things in the copy failed)."

I'm trying to understand if there's a good technical argument for requiring the developer to still do that busy work and we fundamentally believe it's important that they should, or if this is a technical limitation where we'd like to avoid their having to do it but we can't (or can't yet)."

Removing an instruction from the middle of a group would be much more difficult than this because any later instructions would need to be moved back up which would invalidate references to them. Specifically removing only the very last instruction is relatively safe because it can only affect the references to that value, and as you see I made sure to zero it in checked builds so that if anything touches that instruction once it has been removed it will get invalid data and usually hit an assert.

I don't quite understand the reluctance to remove the instruction rather than zero it. Other than the fact that the jit doesn't do this anywhere else (it doesn't zero size anywhere else either) is there particular reason for concern about doing it this way other than it being new?"

> We might want to ignore any runtimeTargets that don't start with win (since we don't really care if someone who builds a .NETFramework project for RID = linux gets wrong asset).

The toolchain has no knowledge of what RID's are ""valid"" for a particular framework, it just provides runtimeTargets in case they might be used.  On .NETCore it's the host's decision to decide if it happens to use one of those (based on the RID fallback graph it has for the particular runtime it's running on).  Package testing is trying to make sure that any asset that ""might"" apply for any RID meets our test criteria.  Since it's not a scenario to restore .NETFramework for non-Windows RIDs I don't think we need to test them (nor force our packages to add non-windows-RID-specific netframework assets)."

@github I think mixing platform conditions (TPI + Targets*) is more confusing than applying platform conditions with the TPI property only (even though inheritance isn't supported with TPI and they might be more verbose). Imagine the following case:

A project has platform specific properties and items:
```
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFrameworks>$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-windows;$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-Linux;$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-OSX</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>

<!-- DesignTimeBuild requires all the TargetFramework Derived Properties to not be present in the first property group. -->
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetPlatformIdentifier>$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)'))</TargetPlatformIdentifier>
  <GeneratePlatformNotSupportedMessage Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'windows'"">...</GeneratePlatformNotSupportedMessage>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(TargetsUnix)' == 'true'"">
  <Compile Include=""..."" />
</ItemGroup>
```

vs.

```
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFrameworks>$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-windows;$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-Linux;$(NetCoreAppCurrent)-OSX</TargetFrameworks>
</PropertyGroup>

<!-- DesignTimeBuild requires all the TargetFramework Derived Properties to not be present in the first property group. -->
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetPlatformIdentifier>$([MSBuild]::GetTargetPlatformIdentifier('$(TargetFramework)'))</TargetPlatformIdentifier>
  <GeneratePlatformNotSupportedMessage Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'windows'"">...</GeneratePlatformNotSupportedMessage>
</PropertyGroup>

<ItemGroup Condition=""'$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'Linux' or '$(TargetPlatformIdentifier)' == 'OSX'"">
  <Compile Include=""..."" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Today only two `Targets*` properties which support inheritance exist (`TargetsUnix` and `TargetsLinux` for Android) and only very few projects depend on that feature. If we think that this change makes the projects that leverage this feature unreadable, we could define such a helper property per project in a property group so that it can be used both for property and item conditions. That said, based on what I saw while making these changes, I don't think that's necessary.

Another fundamental problem with the libraries specific `Targets*` properties is that they have a totally different meaning than the `Targets*` properties that are repo-wide defined, i.e. `TargetsMobile`. The former is inferred from the TargetFramework and hence means the platform that the target framework targets. The latter is inferred from the TargetOS and is just a shorthand form for `' $(TargetOS)' == '...'` conditions. Because of their equal prefix, people used them equally even though they mean something totall different. 
As an example here's one of such mistakes in main today: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/1c80769c0d6e2241cd8a3eeb17cab306d0954d1f/src/libraries/System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters/src/System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.csproj#L12-L14 This condition is only true when the `TargetOS` is one of the mobile OSs but not when the target framework platform is a mobile one. That means that if you compile this library i.e. on a Windows OS the condition will be false vs. when you compile the library on a mobile OS."

"I'm sure this is viable as-is, but if you feel like you have time to tweak it a bit more, I'd suggest it would be preferable not to have the `@github` statement, because then it would be really confusing if you were in the browser UI looking for something in the list that wasn't there because you accidentally loaded the wrong host environment and didn't realise some test cases are only available in some environments.

It would be much clearer if all the entries were present all the time, but if you picked a type that can't be found, we have an error message like ""The type {name} could not be found. It might not be supported when running on this host environment."". This error could be triggered from `Index.razor`'s `SelectedComponentType` getter, or just inline in the Razor UI logic when `SelectedComponentTypeName` is nonempty but `SelectedComponentType` is null.

Also rather than using assembly qualified names, what stops it from working just having the type name (independently of the assembly)? The logic in `Index.razor`'s `SelectedComponentType` uses `Type.GetType` - doesn't that look at all the loaded assemblies?"

This PR is retaining the existing behavior, so there's no risk of anything breaking.

The core of the change is just the file provider. The rest is tests (around 30 or so for the file provider at least) and a few workaround we had to implement before https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/19080 goes in.

We already inserted the SDK changes last week and these changes are the follow-up to consume those changes in the runtime. There is a flag to turn static web assets off and there is also a flag to fallback on to the old version if needed, so we have plenty of options if something goes wrong.

Which while it can happen because I'm not an all omniscient being, we have plenty of tests on the repo that would break if there is an issue here.

It is important to us that we get this on preview7 and into customers hands to iron out any potential issue as soon as possible."

If you feel like there are too many unknowns to do this reasonably well then I am fine with this, but it sucks from a usability perspective.

Are we optimizing for the right user here?

We initially talked about adding this API for the rare user who wants perf/scalability but also wants sync, but I suspect (strongly hope) that this is actually a small group. I expect the biggest user of this to be the one who doesn't care about or doesn't understand scalability, and wants something that ""just works"". If the API has a bunch of non-corner cases where it throws, then this is far from ""just works"" and fails those users.

Perhaps we should rethink the API, making it harder to find (maybe require reflection?) so that you'd only ever use it if you are in the 1st scenario, not the 2nd."

"This specific case is not a good example of how the annotations should work. But let's assume the debugger is somewhere in managed code in the app - so something has a reference to the `ProxyTypeName` property and presumably it does something like:
``` C#
var propertiesToShow = Type.GetType(attr.ProxyTypeName).GetProperties();
```

When linker sees that it goes (basically backwards):
* I need all properties on the type returned by Type.GetType (cause there's a call to GetProperties() on it)
* So it means that the type name coming to Type.GetType must be a type with all properties
* So it means I need the attr.ProxyTypeName to be a type name with all properties -> it should have at least `DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberType.PublicProperties)`.
* If it doesn't -> warn
* So we go and annotate the `ProxyTypeName` with that annotation
* Now running the linker again it will not warn on the usage above anymore, but it will warn in the attribute's .ctor since we're trying to assign an unannotated string to the backing field of `ProxyTypeName`
* So we go and fix that by annotating the `.ctor` argument.
* Running linker again it will not warn in the `.ctor` itself, but it now requires all the callers to fulfill that annotation. But since this is an attribute all callers provide constant strings as the argument - for this linker knows what to do, it finds the type of that name, keeps it and then also keeps all of its properties.

So for the application to work - only the last step is needed, for which only the annotation on the .ctor argument is needed. But that would not be enough for linker to figure out that the code using it is correct - and so it would have to warn (it doesn't do cross method analysis). So the other annotations, like the one on the property, are there to help linker prove that the code is correct and that it will work.

The other advantage is that if later on we change the usage and now call for example `.GetProperties(BindingFlags.NonPublic)`, linker would suddenly warn, because the annotations don't cover private properties anymore and the app may break. Without the annotations flowing through everything it would have no way to tell that there's something wrong.

The reason why the annotations are the same everywhere is that they always mean the same thing - it's a requirement on the value which is passed in. That can be fulfilled either by:
* passing in value with same or ""bigger"" annotation
* passing in statically known value which the linker can actually find - and then it can make sure that type in question fulfills the requirements

Since the method/property itself doesn't which one of the two cases it will be, it applies the annotation - always the same one."

"I decided to implement this option because my analysis was wrong.
First I tried to overwrite the `ToString()` because it's more lightweight.
However, I realized that this does not work for baggage:

Also I decided to add the instance as ActivityProperty because then I've only to create one instance (not an instance per call)."
"This looks wrong, the `#if` just above means this line isn't compiled for watchOS. Maybe the `#if` needs updating?"
I don't think we need to pretend we know what is wrong. A simple error message that file xyz could not be loaded would work
It would be better if instead of `IsAny` you matched the values it should receive to be sure we for example don't send in wrong deviceName or something.
I'm not crazy about it... Especially because I need to match up the variable with the value on the right-hand side to see what its default value is.
"It is wrong to use `bbNext` of a `BBJ_RETURN` block if you're considering flow. You can use `bbNext` of a `BBJ_COND` block to consider the fall-through (non-branch-taken) path, but there is no fall-through for a `BBJ_RETURN`. It shouldn't matter where the 2nd `BBJ_RETURN` exists in the flow graph. Should this really be `b3 = b1->bbJumpDest`? Does anywhere currently check that is the case? "
"I don't follow the ""no meaning"" thing. Isn't the idea that this might not get it right, but the user can just Ctrl+Z if it does something wrong?

Also I think transforming to `$""goo{x + y}bar""` would be the better transformation in this case."

these three assertions look wrong right now.
"OK, so this is broken because of webpack. They wrote `/** @github {keyof LogType} LogTypeEnum */`. `LogType` is `string`. That is `keyof string`. That is wrong. They need to write, instead, `/** @github {keyof typeof LogType} LogTypeEnum */`. Not really sure why this doesn't error in however they're testing their types, but it should.

You're advocating turning simple and functional boolean expressions into multiple imperative if statements with temporary variables. I think that is exactly the wrong way to go.

<hr />

I was looking at what events & counters may be useful to add to connection pooling (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/66605#discussion_r828305848).

For some things, it would be useful to have a reference to every `HttpConnectionPoolManager` in the process.
Having such a list would make it possible to improve a few things:
- Reduce per-request overhead of tracking stats like `http11-requests-in-queue`
  - Doing such tracking inline during the request isn't prohibitively expensive though
- Simplify the cleaning & heartbeat timer logic across pools
  - A single timer can be used for the whole process, instead of toggling timers per manager instance
- Simplify the `NetworkChange` notifications
  - A single notification is sufficient for all managers, avoiding the added logic around the callback registration cleanup
- Simplify other per-pool timer mechanisms
  - Recent example of issues that come along with that: #66782
- We avoid tracking some things like `http11-connections-current-total` when telemetry is disabled. As a result, you will see wrong values if you turn telemetry on later on during the process's lifetime.
  - With a global list, we can always know the correct value

This PR adds such a collection `HttpConnectionPoolManager.AllManagers`, uses a global timer for cleanup & heartbeats and a single `NetworkChange` callback.

Cases where this approach may have a higher overhead:
- You have A LOT of `SocketsHttpHandler` instances that are completely idle (without a single pool)
- You have a lot of handler instances, but your cleaning/heartbeat intervals are really high, making the 1 Hz scanning more expensive

Opening as a draft to gather feedback on whether we think such a change is a horrible idea.

"Any icalls we change the signature of like these need to have their name changed, because any third party callers (like blazor, uno etc) will crash or corrupt the heap by passing the wrong number of arguments (or reading a return value that isn't there).

"> These asserts are generic signs of GC heap corruption. A bug introduced in common parts (e.g. parsing/formatting) can lead to intermittent crash like that.

I'd speculate there may be another issue with `Unsafe.As` then and there is still something wrong with https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/69204/commits/7666952d06c1280d0f0c8c117d599a76df4c0a8d

"> If we're planning on handling this as an ""internal"" navigation attempt, we'll also have to confirm that PDFs are supported on webviews across all platforms. Not a big deal, but just calling it out.

Do you think it would be fine to just load all ""internal"" URLs in the webview by default? If the developer can override this behavior, it seems to me like it would be overreaching a bit to decide which file types we should and shouldn't load in the webview by default (but I could be wrong about this)."

"OK, I've been looking into this, and was able to reproduce the problem with fractional heights by using the following test case in `FetchData.ts`:

```razor
@github (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <div style=""overflow-y: auto; height: 200px; border: 1px solid red;"">
        <Virtualize Items=""forecasts"" Context=""forecast"">
            <div style=""border: 0.2px solid green"" @github=""forecast"">
                <span>@github.Date.ToShortDateString()</span>
                <span>@github.TemperatureC</span>
                <span>@github.TemperatureF</span>
                <span>@github.Summary</span>
            </div>
        </Virtualize>
    </div>
}
```

I also changed the underlying data source to supply 500 items. Without your fix that uses `getBoundingClientRect`, the behavior goes wrong when scrolling quickly because it misjudges its location within the scroll range because the rounding errors add up. In the example above, it just stops adding new items after a certain point, so the user scrolls into a blank white region.

Then, after adding your fix that uses `getBoundingClientRect`, the problem goes away. I could no longer repro any weirdness in the above example.

So, my remaining two questions are:

 * **Why would it be better to use the developer's own provided `ItemSize` value?** It's hard to see how the developer would be able to give a more accurate value than you're calculating at the subpixel level. Your value is more accurate than what's displayed in the browser dev tools, which round to 2dp.
    * Do you have any repro scenario where things still go wrong after applying the `getBoundingClientRect` fix?
 * **Do we care about supporting the case where the developer fails to provide `@github`?** I found that, if not providing that, the scrolling sometimes goes mad and continues scrolling even after I release the mouse wheel. It's a bit worrying because I don't have an exact reason for why it happens or why `@github` fixes it, or if there might be some case where `@github` doesn't fix it.
    * My best guess is there may be some heuristic within the browser whereby when using wheel scrolling (or perhaps with drag scrolling too), it picks an end point that lines up with one of the existing elements, and continues scrolling until that point is reached. But if we're not using `@github`, then it never reaches that point because we keep moving the target element further in the direction you're already scrolling. If this guess is correct, it explains why `@github` fixes it (because the target element gets removed from the DOM and the process ends). However this guess doesn't predict any good solution other than `@github`.
      * For my own future reference: we did consider forcing the equivalent of `@github` by wrapping each item inside a region with sequence number given by the index into the collection. However this behaves badly if items are inserted/removed, as it incorrectly would match/mismatch items against the earlier output. So it's better to force developers to give a `@github` manually corresponding to the actual collection entry or its ID.
    * Personally I think we could consider it a reasonable requirement that you must use `@github` for good performance and reliable scrolling. Certainly it's the most common case. It would just be great if we could avoid the weirdness in the non-key case too, or somehow detect the failure to use `@github`, but don't have a good suggestion for doing either right now.

This is definitely wrong.
">Dim identifier = SyntaxFactory.IdentifierName(NameOf(Enumerable.Cast)) [](start = 24, length = 70)

This looks wrong, I don't believe VB ever uses Cast to convert to the type stated in the As clause. It is used only as an attempt to convert collection to queryable type and only with object as type argument. Several methods can be implicitly called on the collection, sometimes in a sequence, look at CollectionRangeVariableSymbolInfo structure. All information from that structure is sufficient and required to properly do the translation. No need to look at the syntax to check whether it has As clause or not."
Oops wrong one
indentation seems wrong here.
"Note: i still stand by that statement.  We should not be adding lots of complexity to features to handle a 0.0001% case.  We should be investing our efforts in the common cases that proviee high value, and adding support for things people will be doing all the time.  In htat regard, this PR is really helping out this feature.  It goes from being a basic ""i only support inversion in this one basic case"" to ""i support so many common flow control patterns"".  We shoudl not make that job much more difficult to just to support some esoteric cases that were literally dreamt up by a genius dev who loved finding these sorts of crazy cases for fun, but which don't actually come in in the real world :)"

"I see and understand the risk now.

">return this.WrappedSymbol.GetHashCode(); [](start = 16, length = 40)

nit: This _seems_ wrong but I don't have a good argument for why yet. Just a code smell. I don't suppose we can use `System.HashCode.Combine(this.Nullability, this.WrappedSymbol)`? "
"Its more subtle than that.

The default baseline instruction set is Sse, Sse2. However, the jit compiler is told to generate code assuming that it may use Sse, Sse2, Sse3, Ssse3, Sse41, Sse42, Lzcnt, Popcnt, and Pclmqdq. But if the compiler actually uses any of Sse3, Ssse3, Sse41, Sse42, Lzcnt, Popcnt, or Pclmqdq it will notify the crossgen2 managed code. That notification feeds into this logic and if so, we will then mark the method such that the generated code can only be used if the actual hardware supports the instruction set. That's all well and good, and considering that just about all hardware does support these instruction sets, we get crossgen R2R to generate ideal code for all these cases.

The less optimal case is where code attempts to use an Avx, or Avx2 feature, or such. In thoses cases, we will generate code as if the processor does NOT support the feature. In corelib, the idea is that we will audit our code reviews such that such a decision does not make the logic wrong (just slow) (This code auditing is already necessary for our current crossgen1 intrinsics support for corelib), but in the general case we cannot assume that the code will behave correctly if it runs on hardware that does support Avx, Avx2, etc. In that case, what this logic does is record the decision that Avx use was attempted and forbidden. Then the generated code will not be used at runtime, and the JIT will be invoked, if the hardware actually supports Avx/Avx2.

In addition, the --instruction-set argument allows adjusting the baseline instruction set. For instance, if the compiler is run with --instruction-set Sse42, --instruction-set Popcnt --instruction-set Lzcnt, --instruction-set Pclmqdq, then this logic will never kick in, and do anything, as the generated code will never exceed that of the baseline. "
"> I thought we were also parsing in class declarations for error recovery. Is that wrong?

We don't parse statements within a class or a namespace declaration.

"Did the fixer make this change?  It appears to be getting the whitespace ""wrong""; we should validate that trivia is being handled correctly."
"It's based on Dan's numbers for both the downclocking impact (perhaps 30% over 700 microseconds or ~200 microseconds), and the speed advantage for AVX512F over AVX2 (about 400 microseconds at 128*1024). Dan's speed numbers are for relatively low clock rate machines (2.8 and 2.1 GHz), so I think on current hardware, the time difference may be lower due to higher clock rates on both.

I think it's just a rough estimate, but not very wrong.

"This distorts results, for two reasons:

 1. The bitwise-and, possibly in an attempt to make the range positive, subtly distorts the number of results, due to there being one more negative number than there are positive (~~or two, if~~ because `long.MaxValue` is never returned).  If  `FullLong()` returned the correct range, the bitwise-and should be unnecessary.
 1. The modulus operator distorts the results, because usually `maxValue` will not be an integral factor of the range of the random.  [See this for a discussion, and the potential fix if modulus will continue to be used](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10984974/why-do-people-say-there-is-modulo-bias-when-using-a-random-number-generator).

At that time I would expect this code to require revision. Better to attach a syntax node that has the right extent to start with.

The display class created for the foreach control variable _could be_ shared with the closure for any variables declared in the controlled statement. But it _could not be_ the same as for any variables declared in the expression of the foreach loop.

It feels to me as if the issue is the assertion, not the code.

It's probably close to being there, honestly, but the legacy code still has various bits where we have to do evil things. Off the top of my head I don't recall what the precise contract was we ultimately ended up at, so it's possible we had agreed it was safe and then I forgot.

I'm OK doing a tactical fix if we have to, but it sounds like you might indeed have bigger issues at play here. Note that if you do want this for 16.8 it'd have to be merged into release/dev16.8, as 'master' is now 16.9 targeting."

"Thank you for this PR.  It helped me eventually get an armel build.  There are a few issues, but not sure if its related to this or not.

1.)  The dotnet-runtime-6.0.0-dev-linux-armel.tar.gz contains the x64 libclrjit.so.  The nupkg contain the correct armel binaries.
The build output (-v verbose) shows it does the right thing at first, then overwrites libclrjit.so with the wrong version.

2.) The crossgen'd libraries seem to create incorrect code in the build process.  When I execute a simple console application there are odd floating point issues.  For example: Console.WriteLine(1f / 3f) would output ""0"".  A new Timespan would hold seemingly random values.
Rerunning crossgen (w/ readytorun flag) on the armel device fixed this. There are similar issues with AspnetCore.  I had to put the libraries though crossgen on an armel device to make them work w/o odd managed exceptions.  Makes sense with Aspnet as armel doesnt seem to be a supported arch in the build process.  I'm out of my depth on this, but I suspect crossgen might be generating armhf readytorun.

So imagine I somehow got a layout like this:

"I think I will just modify this PR with the plan we decide on.

My understanding of the plan, please correct me if I'm wrong:

1. We leave a ""LibraryBuild"" warning in DependencyInjection that has a good warning message explaining that open generic types can be broken. Maybe even putting an `aka.ms` link to a doc explaining the situation.
2. We add a new runtime check to DependencyInjection that verifies when open generic types are used, they have matching `[DAM]` annotations to the generic types.
    a. The check is only enabled when a new AppContext switch (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.VerifyOpenGenericServiceTrimmability`) is set. By default it isn't set.
3. We enable `VerifyOpenGenericServiceTrimmability` when `PublishTrimmed=true` on the project.

We are recommending that app devs set `PublishTrimmed=true` in their .csproj when they plan on trimming their apps. That way feature switches like BuiltInCOMInterop are configured correctly even when F5 Debugging their untrimmed apps. And the analyzer runs during their build. `VerifyOpenGenericServiceTrimmability` is just another setting that gets defaulted with PublishTrimmed. That way devs will see any errors even before trimming their apps."
"> They look like infrastructure failures, or failures stemming from infrastructure failures.

"> Just for my understanding, this is a difference between debugger-libs+debugger-agent, and icordbg+debugger-agent? And wasm uses the latter, and what uses the former? Please correct me, if I have that wrong!

This just makes that change explicit by marking it as a protocol change and handling the old behavior when appropriate."
"Thanks, @github. I've updated the ref source as well, and retargeted to main for now.

This is a limitation of the WinUI DatePicker; it can only restrict the selectable years: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/winui/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.datepicker?view=winui-3.0#date-values

So the best we can do out of the box is set MinYear and MaxYear. Hopefully at some point we can include [support for the CalendarDatePicker](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/1092), where MinimumDate/MaximumDate is more useful.

"Question: What should happen if the assembly contains `=`? `=` isn't a restricted character; an assembly named `foo=bar=baz.dll` is perfectly kosher.

What *will* happen is that things will *break* two lines down, because the assumption is that there is only one `=` on a line. If there are more than one, the first item is the assembly, the second is the value, but we'd *actually* have a line containing:

    foo=bar=baz=1

but then do `assemblyIdentityMap.Add(""foo"", ""bar"")`, which is wrong.

What we can *instead* do is reorder the values: instead of `ASSEMBLY=DIRECTORY`, do `DIRECTOR=ASSEMBLY`, then use the `string.Split(char[], int)` overload.

For example, if we instead had a line of:

    1=foo=bar=baz.dll

Then `line.Split(new[]{'='}, 2)` will return `new[]{ ""1"", ""foo=bar=baz.dll"" }`, which is fine.

I don't think those are likely to be a problem though.

`IInputEvent::Create` is also called in a couple of places in `InputStateMachineEngine`, but those are exclusively for keyboard and mouse events as far as I can see.

I think the rest are all in tests, which I didn't bother looking at, but I see now they've resulted in some test failures. Hopefully those are just tests that need to be updated, though, and not an indication that there's something fundamentally wrong with this approach."
"> I am not convinced that is a parser error. With several languages, backslashes

I'm sure it was not intended to be an error. Indeed it is still a possibility to preserve a quotation mark in an argument. But we already have an alternative by doubling them. And doubling the backslash is the way out with the current parser. But think about an argument like `""C:\program files\\""`.
Doesn't it feel wrong if the user has to double the last backslash only? And it's not the CMD shell which requires the double backslash...
@github is IMO absolutely right. It's easy to prove  that the app receives the `""C:\""` from my example above. Just print the command line that `GetCommandLineW()` returns. Various shells may require additional escaping in order to pass a final `""C:\""` to the recipient after internal parsing. But that's not ours.

Is it really important to hack the parser like this so one or two IDEs have an easy way of locating the parent tag description and position to insert a link  ?  They can still implement that (although it's harder/hacky/slow for them) without this hack in the compiler... 

In which kind of projects are they trying to support @github ? Which reference syntax are these projects using , the usejsdocs.org one or TypeScript one?  

In the later case, these projects are already breaking usejsdocs ""standard"" so they should not be using @github or {@github} but something else

In the first case, then I assume the motive for this hack is to support IDEs  so they can *easily/fast* recreate the broken parent tag description and find the position to insert the anchor. If that's the case don't you think **they** should be responsible of solving their own problems? And if, as best case, they are just trying to solve the problem of jsdoc referencing once and for all, do you think this is the correct way of doing it?

If this is more or less right, then I'm worried that you didn't consider nor the compiler API user (for which BTW you introduced a breaking change), nor in the jsdoc writer for which TypeScript could provide typechecked references supporting refactors easily, and nor on typeScript developers since althoguh this change affected compiler performance minimally it shows performance place in this project priorities

I made an informal quick proposal  https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16498#issuecomment-508316922 and I would love to document in more detail discuss and implement it, but I would like first to know if such feature would be accepted ? 

I think TypeScript now has the opportunity to define the definitely and single way of document JavaScript APIs as other languages have, and a feature like this would help a lot in that direction.

">  the instruction counts will be wrong in dumps which will be confusing

They are wrong currently because of `align` instructions as well. Although it will be good to fix it at one point, but I didn't notice it until I tried it today to double check.

E.g. in below assembly code, we insert `align` instruction but then decided not to do the alignment.

> is there particular reason for concern about doing it this way other than it being new?

The reason I am reluctant is because the notion of updating the `insCount` is new and I am not sure if all the code of all targets (when we support armarch) is resilient to this. Nor we are not sure if we have enough test coverage to all possible affected paths. Errors can come not just from asserts but also silent bad code gen which takes time to debug and investigate."

"As a new-comer to this code, it feels wrong to provide incorrect key sizes and results for ""IsValidKeySize"".

If I'm not missing anything there will be no user callback querying `LocalEndpoint` in case of failure, however we may end up adding internal code doing so in the future, for example in a tracing call like this:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f8e92ecfdd329d1f0c4a1ccc1ae494282d9a3050/src/libraries/System.Net.Sockets/src/System/Net/Sockets/Socket.cs#L1083

Such a call may enforce caching a wrong value for `LocalEndpoint` permanently, on the other hand it's probably very unlikely we do such a thing by accident. I wonder if it makes sense to add tests to ensure such failing async methods will not alter the sockets internal state in an unwanted way.

Honestly white spaces seems to be causing a lot of issues with the test that was preexisting, I am wondering if I really should just have the code just strip whitespace characters on the formatting as well. There might also be some places from my code that also gets subject to that just with something like this I think:

"@github it is kind of hard to asses the risk here, even though I believe this was wrong before and the fix should not introduce any failure modes.

The problematic code path is specific to unloadability and the comment that was there indicated that there is no need for added reference, yet it was adding one via the not obvious handling of references in the CollectibleAssemblyHolder.

"> I'm on the fence about ValueTask. On one hand, RequestDelegate doesn't return a ValueTask and we're not returning an async value so we can just use Task.CompletedTask were appropriate. On the other hand, ValueTask gives us the most flexibility if we ever want to try anything crazy like returning pooled tasks for async operations. Of course, that's only worthwhile if whoever is awaiting the action doesn't immediately convert the ValueTask to a Task like the middleware pipeline would.

I think it should be `Task` since all of our existing APIs today are Task based. No point introducing friction here.

> What potential IResults are you thinking of that don't write a response? I know StatusCodeResult for example doesn't flush the response so something could completely change the response afterwards, but in practice it's effectively writing a response with the specified status code and an empty body the vast majority of the time.

Definitely possible to respect this setting but it would need more public API to flow the setting via a feature as part of the transport layer or have an https specific setting (it'd be a layering violation to flow this existing setting directly into kestrel). I didn't want to do either as part of this PR because it requires a new API and I didn't measure any performance difference is basic scenarios."

Probably the right place. It is not a goal to duplicate the lowering as compiler does, the goal is to accurately reflect the semantics, the order of evaluation and conditional nature of evaluation.

"> I understand that approxparents is being passed correctly, but why isn't it preventing the exact type load?

This is a type that has never been loaded before, and approxparents doesn't help in this case of server GC (and AFAIK, not even with regular GC). The issue with server GC is that it doesn't have a valid `Thread` object associated with its thread, and the TypeLoader uses that `Thread` object in its locking logic. Without one, we AV right now. Even without server GC, in a checked build, we will hit this debug only code here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/vm/siginfo.cpp#L1104, which uses the `DontLoadTypes` flag, and we'll hit the assert right after this call because we'll get back a null TypeHandle.

My understanding is that approxparents won't help if the type has not been previously loaded to at least approxparents, because we should never be allowed to create types (not even to the level of approxparents) during GC. Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.

One possible easy way to fix this is to handle the null `Thread*` case, to avoid the AV, but I believe this would be a hack to mask one of the symptoms, and the bottom line is, we should still never load any type during GC. So I don't think this would be a correct fix.

I currently see 2 patterns here where we could be calling into a MethodDesc's entry point without potentially loading the valuetypes in the signature:

1. Entry points returned from dictionary lookups that we directly call into (Ex: delegates. I haven't verified that the bug exists in this scenario though).
2. Entry points returned by the `JIT_VirtualFunctionPointer` helper (the case of this bug here)

In these two cases, when jitting the callers of such methods, the JIT is dealing with the canonical version of things, so all the places where the JIT/JIT interface calls into the `classMustBeLoadedBeforeCodeIsRun` won't help.

The possible fix I see here is to call the `MethodDesc::WalkValueTypeParameters()` on these MethodDescs for which we return an entry point out of the two lookups I mentioned above, and load valuetypes in the signature to at least approxparents level.

If this doesn't feel like the right thing to do, this means that when we load these MethodDescs on the TypeLoader side, we should perform this step of walking the parameters and loading them, but this could be an overkill, and I think it might be better to perform that kind of loading only when we're about to execute the methods.

This is probably related to this issue here. I currently cannot say, whether this is a direct result of a wrong declaration of the `System.Data.OleDb.tagDBPARAMS` structure itself, or just a result of some other incorrect structure or behavior in OleDb, that will crash the app much later, but I would assume, it is the latter.

This mostly happens after at least 300 calls, but can happen after 700 calls or even never in our test runs.

Also note, that this behavior happens on an x64 test run, so there seem to be some issues with those as well and it might not be automatically the case, that the x64 structure definitions (or their marshaling) are correct.

Because of your 15K test suite, we are happy to test any fixes."
"@github looks good!

Looking at the test results, it appears that @github and I were wrong. Even though you add the simplifier annotation to the resultant node we see test case failures [like this](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=705352&view=ms.vss-test-web.build-test-results-tab&runId=21851220&resultId=101287&paneView=debug):

```diff
int i = 0;
-return i switch
+return ((int)i) switch
{
  1 => 4,
  _ => 7,
}; 
```

At this point I would change the PR to conditionally add the cast and file a bug that the simplification service does not kick in here."
"I have been thinking a bit more about this `TypeFlags.Intersection` check, and I think it is too permissive because the intersection could have unions as constituents. Here is an example:

``` ts
interface Target {
    x?: number;
}
interface A1 {
    a: any;
    x: string;
}
interface A2 {
    a: any;
    x2: string;
}
interface B1 {
    b: any;
    x: string;
}
interface B2 {
    b: any;
    x2: string;
}

var t: Target;
var s: (A1 | A2) & (B1 | B2);
t = s;
```

This assignment is supposed to fail, because no matter which side of the intersection you're looking it, there could be a union constituent where x has the wrong type (string instead of number). But because you are recursively diving into the properties of the unions as well as the intersections, you end up losing information about the property x. As a result, we allow the assignment, even though it is bad.

"currently we are tearing off `this` which might be wrong in cases if custom version of `CompilerHost` uses it in its implementation of `getCanonicalFileName`.

"> I'm not so sure about that. I think there are legit scenarios which will never care about trimming, mostly complex apps with a shared framework like VS. Why should we limit everyone to a common ground if the needs are different for large and small apps?

I don't see the problem here to be honest. If a given app doesn't care about trimming that's fine. Some features will be ""broken"" when trimming (startup hooks as an example), those features will produce warnings. But if I can build my app without warnings its behavior should be consistent across all of the builds where I don't get warnings. I think @github take on this is the right one - the behavior will not be identical, different build configurations are intentionally modifying some behavior of the app (debug enables better debugging experience, self-contained changes deployment requirements, ...). But features which are not intentionally affected by the change of configuration should NOT be affected. Crazy example: building the app as Debug should not run it with a different default culture when compared to Release.

It's kind of hard to make a broad statement, since there will always be exceptions and gotchas, but I would much like to make a relatively simple statement about the consistency of behavior across different build/publish configurations. To me it's about expectations - clicking a single check-box in VS to enable single-file doesn't ""feel"" dangerous, so it should not break my app (or if it will, it should tell me -> warnings).

> Self-contained versus framework-dependent

I think that some verticals will not support framework-dependent and that's OK, but those which will should behave consistently across the two configurations. To that end the verticals which don't support framework-dependent should warn if I try to force it - building Blazor client WASM app should fail/warn if I explicitly state --self-contained false. (It actually does fail today, but for different reasons, which is not ideal)."

"Right, the FCall existed already but it was only ever being used to set the target to `null`. I'm definitely not a GC internals expert so I might be wrong, but from what I can see it would appear that the target of a dependent handle is stored in a `GCHANDLE` in the VM, which does seem to support updating the referenced object? As in, if `DependentHandle` is storing the target through a normal GC handle (although with the mode set to dependent), shouldn't the same functionality from `GCHandle.Target` apply here as well? Either way I'd love to learn more about this 😄

I guess we can ask @github to confirm this and then decide how to proceed with the API?
I'm thinking if this is actually supported then we might just need to decide how to prevent users from setting the target to `null` and then back to a valid object, or alternatively if it isn't we could just make `Target` a readonly property to fix the issue? 🤔"

## Customer Impact

Fixes a bug reported by customer via email, where an async read operation performed on a `FileStream` opened for **non-seekable device** file was throwing an `System.IO.IOException`: ""The parameter is incorrect"".

It turns out that `ReadFile` [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-readfile#parameters) was wrong:

> For an hFile that does not support byte offsets, Offset and OffsetHigh are ignored.

And `OVERLAPPED` [doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-overlapped#members) was right:

> This member is nonzero only when performing I/O requests on a seeking device that supports the concept of an offset (also referred to as a file pointer mechanism), such as a file. Otherwise, this member **must be zero**.


## Testing

We already had a test for that, but it's part of Outerloop and that is why the regression was missed:

```log
      System.IO.Tests.DeviceInterfaceTests.DeviceInterfaceCanBeOpenedForAsyncIO [FAIL]
        System.IO.IOException : The parameter is incorrect. : '\\?\hid#vid_0b0e&pid_24c8&mi_03&col02#b&92ae56&0&0001#{4d1e55b2-f16f-11cf-88cb-001111000030}'
        Stack Trace:
          D:\projects\runtime\src\libraries\System.IO.FileSystem\tests\FileStream\FileStreamConformanceTests.Windows.cs(209,0): at System.IO.Tests.DeviceInterfaceTests.DeviceInterfaceCanBeOpenedForAsyncIO()
          --- End of stack trace from previous location ---
    Finished:    System.IO.FileSystem.Tests
```

The test was used to ensure that it's passing now.

## Risk

Very low.

"Everyone, thank you for the discussion, but this is not the place for it.  This PR is simply using a now-existing C# feature, it is not designing nor implementing that feature in the language or compiler (if the feedback were on how the feature was employed in dotnet/runtime, that would be appropriate here, but that's not what this discussion has become).  The C# language design team doesn't regularly pay attention to this repo, nor to specific PRs in this repo, and this is not where the community-at-large expects to find and discuss language features.  Feedback on a language feature on a PR in this repo will largely go unseen by the relevant folks.  If you would like to provide feedback on C# language design, the right place is https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang.  If you feel strongly that `!!` is the wrong design and/or could be improved, as I requested earlier please open an issue in https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues to discuss it there, where language discussions are had and language decisions are made.

If it had a NULL password or an empty password it will load using the simple ctor.  If it's a PFX with a password other than those two values, then it'd throw an exception for the password being wrong.

> I want to avoid forcing people to convert their certificate format to do this

In my experience (and certainly in the Linux+Let's Encrypt+certbot case) a PEM key is paired with a PEM cert; particularly because they'll use openssl commands, which use PEM output unless you tell it otherwise.

> this is something that I've seen used in other web frameworks too. (DER Cert + PEM key)

Can you give some examples?

> Will this be a problem as long as we check that the certificate loaded in advance doesn't have an associated private key or are there any other issues we should be aware of.

The X509Certificate2 constructor, much to my chagrin, doesn't do simple things.  It does complex things.  The input data can be:

* X.509 public key certificate, binary encoded
* X.509 public key certificate, PEM encoded
* (Not Linux today, bug should be fixed later in 5) A PKCS#7 SignedCms object, binary encoded, where the first signer cert is used
* (Not Linux today, bug should be fixed later in 5) A PKCS#7 SignedCms object, PEM encoded, where the first signer cert is used
* (Windows-only) An authenticode-signed exe, dll, msi, msu, etc, where the first signer cert is used.
* (Windows-only) The SerializedCert format (Windows-proprietary) and probably other things.
* A PKCS#12 PFX, binary encoded

If you really wanted to support both the binary and PEM encoding of a certificate, but restrict the inputs to more sensible things, you could use X509Certificate2.GetCertContentType to ask what it is, and only accept X509.  That still eliminates the case where you load a PFX and have a keyfile specified (and avoids writing the key to disk at all in that error case)."
"Is it possible we need a more explicit signal that the Blazor Server client-side code is wired up and ready to go?

Reacting to the WebSockets traffic is an indicator that things have started happening, but I'm not sure it guarantees that `blazor.server.js` has got as far as activating the link click interception. There might still be some time gap where it can go wrong.

We are a bit limited in what we can do when testing the templates, as we can't add any test-specific logic to the application being tested. If we're keen to solve this, one option would be something like getting PlayWright to wait until the DOM contains some artifacts that are specific to interactive rendering, such as the comment marker tags we put around component outputs, or even explicitly looking for the delegating event handler registered on the root element.

If you think this is sufficiently unlikely to make a difference then I'm fine with leaving it until we see reliability issues. Might be good to clarify the comment in the test sources though to at least state what kind of test reliability issue this logic is meant to mitigate."
"@github 
I discussed how to structure the options with DavidP.
We're thinking it may be better to stick with boolean options (rather than enum options), but have more than one (one for literals, one for lambdas, one for everything) when we want, under one section.
Then it would look like the section for ""var"" preferences:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12466233/30287461-0481c7e4-96da-11e7-8132-706435dfd50c.png)

In the meantime, it would be a single boolean option for literals.

This would also solve a technical problem. When I tried to fix the code above (since `BooleanCodeStyleOptionViewModel` because I pass an option that's wrong), the constructor for `EnumCodeStyleOptionViewModel` does not seem to handle per-language options, but only plain options.

Let me know if that approach seems ok."

However, I don't really recommend that as it has a lot of magic that can go wrong that is hard to debug specifically when you start mixing COM and WinRT, InProc and OutOfProc, and STA and MTA.

Instead, I *think* we want (-ish):

```csharp
var jdks = new[]{new JdkInfo (androidSdk.JavaSdkPath)}.Concat (Tools.JdkInfo.GetKnownSystemJdkInfos (logger));
var jdk = jdks.Where (j => j.MaxVersion != null ? j.Version <= maxVersion : true)
    .Where (j => j.IncludePath.Any ())
    .FirstOrDefault ();
if (jdk == null)
    Log.LogError (…);
// use jdk...
```

Error checking excluded.  If `$(JavaSdkDirectory)` is set and is valid -- i.e. `AndroidSdkInfo` was constructed -- then we should use `new JdkInfo ($(JavaSdkDirectory))` aka `new JdkInfo (androidSdk.JavaSdkPath)`, and use that *preferentially*.

Question about this preferential use: if e.g. JDK 9 is specified, *should we use it*?  That might be helpful for testing new JDK versions.

If `$(JavaSdkDirectory)` *isn't* set/`AndroidSdkInfo` doesn't construct, *then* we should consult `JdkInfo.GetKnownSystemJdkInfos()`."
Nope. We fixed this with #5934 :smile: we got some of the widths wrong
"I think maybe we are conflating two issues:

1. There are bugs in `ApiCompat` that have led to wrong (DIM members) or unclear (changing return types) error messages.
2. `ApiCompat` is not an API differ, it only reports API breakages.

This PR seems to implement `#2` (an API differ) as a temporary fix for `#1`, which is probably fine, but we should consider what our long-term goal is here.

Once `ApiCompat` is fixed, it will no longer show `InterfacesShouldHaveSameMembers`, but this doesn't really help us understand what **is** changing.  We could accidentally be adding tons of new public members that we didn't intend.

Long-term, I think what we want is: a report generated that shows **any** changes to our public API (`#2`).  And the process that generates this report raises an error if any of those changes are **breaking**.

Somehow we want to enforce not only that we don't introduce **breaking** changes, but that any change to our public API is intentional.

I think the Components team may have built tooling for these scenarios, since they faced the exact same issue."

"Ok, I was wrong about this.  The problem is that System.Numerics.Vectors is not yet yet built in source-build at the point when Roslyn is built because we need Roslyn to build runtime.  Our usual fix for this is to let the repo use a ref-only version of the package to break the cycle.  This ref-only version contains no `lib` directory, so this copy fails.  To my knowledge we haven't seen any issues in source-built SDKs caused by this, but I would be happy to use another fix if possible.  To me this is very similar to [DiaSymReader](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/NuGet/Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset/DesktopCompilerArtifacts.targets#L32) that we exclude from source-build as well."

```ts
type Crazy<T> = T extends [infer P, (infer R extends string ? string : never)] ? P & R : string;
```
we can apply the refactoring and extract `(infer R extends string ? string : never)` to obtain this:

"Double checking on https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-algorithm, recognizing both null and undefined here for `exports` seems good (only one usage makes that explicit, but it should be fine), however ignoring `main` and looking up an index regardless is not what `PACKAGE_RESOLVE` describes for an `export`less package... it just says `Return the URL resolution of packageSubpath in packageURL.`, which doesn't imply any fallback to `index.js` lookup if the `main` fails.

"This code change is semantically correct. As the next instruction is a call to a function implemented in C++, the detail is that STDCALL abi does not consider EFLAGS to be part of the input argument set, nor are they expected to be preserved across a call.

While the guidance for writing high performance, dense assembly suggests using xor in this way, the performance/size characteristics of this particular function is such that it will not have an impact on the product, and the existing code is (somewhat) easier to read for developers who may not be as familiar with assembly. That guidance is much more important for compiler developers than for engineers writing small amounts of hand-coded assembly.

I do not believe we should take this change, as the existing logic is somewhat more self-documenting as its meaning, and the updated logic, while not wrong, does not improve the codebase. In addition, this change does not update the numerous other locations throughout or assembly code which also use the mov register, 0 pattern."
"@github Please review the TypeSystem + inlining changes
@github Please review that small fix in the R2RDump tool (assert repeated twice, one of them at the wrong place)

"@github I would be fine with that!

One thing to make sure of though is, with regards to incremental parsing:

if you use the same `SyntaxKind` in multiple places, you are effectively stating that any node with that kind is interchangeable in that place.  i.e.   by stating that you take a VariableDeclaration `SyntaxKind` there, you are stating that any node with `SyntaxKind.VariableDeclaration` could then go there.  Is that actually the case?

i.e. can you see all these variable patterns in a binding:

```
a) simple name:                        a
b) name with type:                     a: number
c) name with initializer:              a = expr
d) name with type and initializer:     a: number = expr
```

?

If these are all things that can show up in a binding element list, then reusing `SyntaxKind.VariableDeclaration` is definitely a safe and appropriate thing to do. 

However, If any of them cannot show up in a binding element list, then using this `SyntaxKind` here would be problematic.  The issue is that we could have a normal variable declaration from the old tree, see that that's what you want in the parser currently, and then reuse the node in the binding element list.  We'd do that, even though it's not valid in the new context because it's not what the parser would actually produce for that code any more.

From looking at parseBindingElement, i think this is not safe (but i could be reading things wrong!).  For example, i don't think you support forms 'b' or 'd' in a binding element list.  As such, i would lean on having a new BindingElement `SyntaxKind` that would accurately demarcate these nodes, and prevent them from being used in places where we actually want a real VariableDeclaration (and vice-versa).

In terms of their structural shape, they would of course be the same.  But in terms of their `SyntaxKind`, they would clearly indicate that they represented non-interchangeable pieces of code.

"This by itself didn't fix the issue for me. 
Because I'm desperate and have been struggling with this for a while, this (in addition to fixes in this PR) solved it for me:

in the bottom of `function cloneSourceFileWithChanges(`
```javascript
            node.pragmas = source.pragmas || new Map();
            node.text = source.text || """";
            return node;
```
But maybe parts of it can be solved in:
`var node = baseFactory.createBaseSourceFileNode(303 /* SourceFile */);` ?

---

Edit: After further testing, I only needed the above change to `cloneSourceFileWithChanges` to solve my issue, not the change in the PR.

---

Edit2: I had 2 projects in an microfrontends environment, one was a library with some files that had a file in `<projectRoot>/model/<filename>.ts` and `<projectRoot>/<filename>/package.json` that referenced it. 
When importing from the 2nd project, if imprting like vscode suggested `<projectRoot>/model/<filename>`, I get this error. 
When importing the `package.json` path instead it works: `import <filename> from ""<projectRoot>/<filename>"";`
Basically, a horrible debug experience where I had to dig through github issues, the typescript compiler and various other things because I imported something the wrong way. 
But adding the above mentioned lines to the clone method solved the issue symptoms for me, but in fact I should fix the import... 

---

Edit3: I experienced issues with this 4 months later. 
I added 
```javascript
            if (node.pragmas === undefined) {
                console.log(""Error when importing: "" + node.fileName)
                console.log(node)
                console.log(""Should import the package.json, not the ts-file!"")
            }
```
to `cloneSourceFileWithChanges` in my `typescript.js` file to at least give some kind of non-worthless message."

When converter type and property type are different (obviously they must be compatible anyway), for value types a box (getter) / unbox_any (setter) and for reference types a castclass (setter) is emitted.
The reflection based accessor works without changes but the thrown exception types when the deserialized object has the wrong type are different.

"Dear @github,

I got assigned https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/57768 and I thought to myself ""ahh, I guess thats just a missing scenario"".
So I went to create a failing test only to find that you added one in 2018 with a comment saying ""documenting current behaviour"", so I thought ""ahh, I guess there is just nothing that is checking for missing trivia"".
So I went looking only to find that there is code to look for missing trivia, and add an ElasticMarker (which is ElasticZeroSpace) in those situations.
So I thought ""this is probably wrong, but let me make it ElasticSpace and see which tests break"" but none of them did.
So I tried all of the RemoveUnnecssary* tests and they all passed.
So I tried all of the simplifier tests and they all passed.
So I turn to you, dear sir, to tell me why I'm wrong here.

I assume the answer is ""ElasticMarker is supposed to work here, the formatter must be wrong"", but since I can't find where in the formatter that is processed, I thought I'd throw this up as a hail mary just in case :)

Logically after an update is applied, tokens refer to rows in tables that are a concatenation of all the added rows from every update.  (ie: if the baseline table 0x23 had 2 rows and then generation 1 an added 3 more rows, an index like 0x05
refers to table 0x23 row 3 from gen 1).

The way the lookup works is that the EnC map table records the logical tokens of the update.  So for table 0x23 the 3 additions in gen 1 will have entries like encmap row 5 = 0x23000003, row 6 = 0x23000004, row 7 = 0x23000005, and then rows for the next table and so on.  The relative index in gen1 of token 0x23000005 then, is the distance of its row (ie row 7) from the first token for the table (ie row 5), plus 1 (since tokens are 1-based).  So in this case token 0x23000005 corresponds to the 7-5+1 = 3rd row of table 0x23 in the gen1 dmeta image.

The problem is that previously we returns this index-base+1 computation even in cases where we walked either to the end of the encmap table or past the last row for the table we care about.

In the case where we walked to the end of the encmap table, the index-base+1 could sometimes return a value that looked like a valid token.  The upshot is that we looked up an incorrect AssemblyRef (0x23 table) from the wrong generation.

The updated code returns -1 for all cases where we didn't find an encmap row for our given token.

"> One case we lose loops, for Int32ToHexChars...

For cases like these with OR exit conditions, we'd need multiple blocks to be handled during inversions. Basically look at all the backedges into the loop top block, and if any of those come from blocks ""below"" that first exit... they also need to be duplicated.

You can't handle the subsequent blocks quite the same way as the first one. That is, copying the block code into the block before the loop is wrong, you now need a new block.

I wonder if there's some simple way to forestall this, eg settting a bb flag on key blocks during inversion?"

As discussed offline, according to the current merged wrapper
architecture, for architecture-variant tests all versions
are compiled and the ""wrong"" variants get skipped at runtime
using the ConditionalFact attribute. Sadly for some of the ILPROJ
tests JITting the ""wrong"" variant ends up crashing the JIT during
Crossgen2 compilation. We can follow up by figuring out whether
the crash is intentional but for now a simple way to work around
this problem (hitting just a small number of tests) is to mark
them as out-of-process tests so that the wrong variants get
filtered out early and R2R compilation is not triggered for them.

Thanks

"> If anything, BlockingCollection has been superseded by more modern patterns such as [System.Threading.Channels](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/an-introduction-to-system-threading-channels/) so we should encourage users to adopt that instead.

@github my understanding is that the [Channels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.channels) are intended for asynchronous scenarios. Using them is synchronous scenarios will require blocking on asynchronous methods that return `ValueTask`s, that require converting these to `Task`s with [`AsTask`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.valuetask.astask), that will result in an allocation on each blocking operation.

Fixes: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/69010

We map the entire file and then adjust the pointer to get to the bundle. When we need to unmap, having the bundle, we reverse the adjustment to get the address of the mapping.
The math for reversing the adjustment was incorrect. The adjustment due to embedding in larger container (such as universal binary) was applied with a wrong sign. For large binaries we could offset the pointer beyond the mapping and unmap something random - if there is nothing mapped there, no harm, if something is mapped (like our own binary) we could cause crashes.

"I think `Activity` lifecycle events and `Application` lifecycle events are 2 different things. They may sometimes (mostly incase of single Activity) fire together but they're not always synonymous.

If an `Activity` corresponds to `Window` then it is not correct to assume it's lifecycle events applies to the whole application. This is wrong in 2 cases, multiple `Window`s/`Activity`s and background services.

I guess the current implementation in MAUI uses the `Activity`'s event because there are no corresponding events on the `Application` class (except for OnCreate). The `Xamarin.AndroidX.Lifecycle.Process` package provides those events and I think it will be a more accurate implementation.

"> Otherwise, we might be able to do it in our `ResolveNativeProjectReference` target. (Though I'm not sure if the fast up to date check runs targets to collect `UpToDateCheckInput`, or if they have to be static).

"But I really feel like this code has to be somewhere in the speculation analyzer and not scattered around individual features. Doing this fixes bugs in other features too. One example I found is:

        break;
}
```
do inline temporary on 'b' - it will use replace 'b' with 'default' and produce the error.
But with this change, it will introduce a cast and the resulting code will be correct:
```c#
switch (true)
{
    case ((bool)(default)):
        break;
}
```

edit: I'm wrong, this particular case actually works with either approach because the simplifier uses the same helper."

that seems wrong. @github is this expected?
"> I am not sure what you mean - assert failure here means operation.FormatString != null && operation.FormatString.Kind != OperationKind.Literal. What additional information does your approach give over this one?

The ```Assert.True``` when fails simply says the value is false when it was expected to be true. The ```Assert.Equal``` tells you what was the actual value when it is not matching the expectation, therefore providing valuable information, which often allows to understand what went wrong without debugging the test. It is fine if you don't want to make this change, I'll do it myself after the PR is merged.

In reply to: [186062344](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/26545#discussion_r186062344) [](ancestors = 186062344,185968286)"
"> So isn't this a problem with entire handling of model binding of `""null""` json on nullable parameter with `TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue==true`?

I do not think that the condition is wrong just because we did some improvements (.NET 7) in how we are treating the AllowEmptyBody based on the Nullabity in I feel only very specific scenarios will allow `empty body` and not `null` or vice versa.

> @github Bruno Lins de Oliveira FTE Is there anything wrong with just removing the `if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)` branch entirely `SystemTextJsonInputFormatter` and always `return InputFormatterResult.Success(model);` when `JsonSerializer.DeserializeAsync()` doesn't throw?

@github  As we discussed, ""null"" and empty body are different, however, MVC treat them as the same for STJ for a long time and change might cause some breaking change. We changed to make the empty body better and most of the cases when a ""null"" is accepted will be covered by this new mechanism, as example:

```c#
public ActionResult([FromBody] Contact? contact) {}
```
or
``` c#
public ActionResult([FromBody] Contact contact = null) {}
```

Until .NET 6 they used to be blocked for both (null and empty body) because we were not using the optionality to allow them. Now, .NET 7, both actions will be accepted (null and empty body).

Since the mechanism will behave differently, as I mentioned, not change it right now might be the best and going back to the original idea of just update the error message to differentiate between `Empty Body` and `null` is a less breaking change.

> Since the comment made it clear there are some inputs being regarded as null I wanted to make sure the json is null literal (which I am not entirely sure how to do since request stream is of course non seekable).

I think the comment about `whitespace` is not true, as you mentioned, and the only situation where we will get a `null` value from the System.Text.Json will be when we have a literal `null`, so i feel we can safe say (only for System.Text.Json) this:

``` csharp
if (model == null && !context.TreatEmptyInputAsDefaultValue)
{
            context.ModelState.TryAddModelError(context.ModelName, ""null value not supported"");
            return InputFormatterResult.Failure();
}
```

That will produce a better error message, without change the current behavior. And the new mechanism or the user option to allow empty body will be used to decide if the failure will happen or we will treat as `Success` binding.

Also, I think we should keep the `NewtonsoftJsonInputFormatter` as-is for now.

@github anything to add based on our discussion?
@github is that make sense for you?

I was trying to update several deps at once or I would of already done this one. I also verified this change did not cause any issues. But it brings more features and bug fixes that may make our current parser a bit better.

> The right-hand side of an 'in' expression must not be a primitive.

Regarding my suggestion for `getApparentType`: I forgot it maps primitives to their corresponding object type (e.g. `number` to `Number`), so that won’t work across the board.

I’ve been playing with this for most of the morning, and there are a lot of missing pieces with unions and intersections that get pretty confusing to think about, especially when comparing with the existing behavior. Eventually, I settled on the principle that we should only suppress this error when there exists some safe instantiation of the RHS type, but it is impossible to narrow the expression down to that type. The goal is that if the user writes the appropriate type guards, they should not get an error for using an in-expression inside those guards, even though the compiler doesn’t narrow through them. Here are the additional tests I came up with:

```ts
function union1<T extends string | number, U extends boolean>(thing: T | U) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because all possible instantiations are errors)
}

function union2<T extends object, U extends string | number>(thing: T | U) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because narrowing is possible)
  if (typeof thing === ""object"") {
    ""key"" in thing; // Ok
  }
}

function union3<T>(thing: T | string | number) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because narrowing is possible)
  if (typeof thing !== ""string"" && typeof thing !== ""number"") {
    ""key"" in thing; // Ok, because further narrowing is impossible
  }
}

function union4<T extends object | ""hello"">(thing: T) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Ok (because narrowing is impossible)
}

function intersection1<T extends number, U extends 0 | 1 | 2>(thing: T & U) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because all possible instantiations are errors)
}

function intersection2<T>(thing: T & (0 | 1 | 2)) {
  ""key"" in thing; // Error (because all possible instantations are errors)
}
```

Currently, both in master and in your PR, only `union1` and `union2` exhibit the “wrong” behavior, but it shifted a bit in my quick experiments, so having the rest of those tests will be useful.

One hint is that you probably want to use `getConstraintOfType` instead of the `immediateBaseConstraint` property, for several reasons, one of which is that it works on unions and intersections. My only concern with that though is that it may not be suitable to differentiate between what we have in `union3` and `union4`. You may need to have different logic based on whether `rightType` is “a type variable whose constraint is a union” vs. “a union that includes type variables with some relevant constraint”.

"@github/roslyn-ide: some background on this: when @github started doing the source generator work, he did a quick hack to get source generators to run after we produced a compilation in the compilation tracker. Since this was happening _after_ the core workspace processed stuff, this had various problems: TryGetCompilation and GetCompilationAsync would have returned different things, P2P references probably would have been broken, etc. This tries to move the core running into the compilation tracker so there aren't so many things broken with it.

This is still a prototype although one that compiler is interested in dogfooding. The primary goals are:

1. The compilation tracker should behave the same as usual if you aren't on the preview langver, since this all gets short-circuited there.
2. Starting to test out the APIs so we can get some initial experimentation with them.

Out of scope of this PR is:

1. Fleshing out the prototype (you'll see a number of places where the compiler hasn't implemented something, and so we have to punt work because of that.)
2. Trying to use the compiler's incremental update API -- that'll take more work. We've also identified a few API gaps too that need to be addressed before we can do that, we think.
3. Any sort of remotely smart performance handling.
4. Any representation of these in a smart way in the Workspaces layer.

Once this is in to unblock compiler dogfooding, then we'll tackle those. This is emphatically a ""look, we're walking now"" PR where the goal is just to make things be Not Entirely Wrong(tm).

@github and I have been going back and forth on this so we now have some additional feedback on his APIs. Expect those PROTOTYPE comments to go away."
"> It would indeed be exceptional if the compiler passed us tokens of an unexpected syntax.

I don't understand what that means.  I can't find any direct information specifying what is/isn't expected syntax.  I've reverse engineered to the best of my ability.  However, none of this is contracted.  It's all just based on the current impl.  

That's why i write to what i think is going on, but am resilient to me getting things wrong.  

> Yes, it would be a bug in the IDE code that we are not handling some kind of new token syntax or a bug in the compiler that they are producing some kind of bad tokens. In both cases it's our code!

The compiler layer is not our code.  It's the compiler layer.  We should not be crashing in our code if the compiler changes to do something which is legal which we didn't expect.  

The compiler has not promised any invariants here.  IDE should not assume and shoudl not expect a particualr form if it isn't promised.

And yes, it's a bug in our code if we don't handle something from the compiler.  Hence why i assert.  So we can collect the information and decide what to do.  I do not throw an exception though as that's not an *exceptional* occurrence.  

> OK, now I'm confused. Isn't that what I'm saying?

No.  Because tehre are no invariants promised by teh compiler here.  So we shouldn't crash.  If you can get teh compiler to doc explicitly how this works on their end with their tokens, i'm happy to take away the zealous checking, and i'm fine with then crashing if something goes awry.  In *that* case we would be able to track this down to either:

1. the compiler has a bug and is not fitting their documented invariants.  i.e. a compiler bug, which should go to them.
2. the ide didn't understand the invariant of the compiler properly and wrote innapropraite code.  i.e. an IDE bug which would go to them.

Right now we have the compiler producing undocumented data (i.e without invariant) which we are processing.  In the case of undocumented data, we can attempt to work properly on expected patterns, but it woudl be irresponsible to throw or crash on patterns we didn't expect.  We should instead just report this so we can determine what's going on.  

In other words, it's not *exceptional* for the compiler to produce data within their specified contract.  They are allowed to produce what they want, and we need to be resilient to it all.

"> My point wasn't specifically Read, it was that the virtual methods on a derived Stream aren't able to be trimmed.

Understood, thanks.  I'm highlighting that most of those overrides throw just like the one in this PR, they just throw a more appropriate exception that requires a tiny bit more logic to compute.  So it doesn't look like we're saving a ton by having a custom ConsoleStream just for wasm; correct me if I'm wrong.  The larger piece here seems to be the avoidance of the terminal db code, which ended up getting brought in per https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35555#issuecomment-620723308 as part of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/2ef9d363a2cdc5be0850f31d31f4a20e9202624c"
"> The ExplictLayoutSize test was wrong

Interesting, that test is copy-pasted from NUTC (and so is the field layout algorithm bug for that matter). I guess it won't meet the bar to fix it there unless it's user reported.

Yeah, I was meaning to just delete it at some point. It has long history..."
"I'll need to fix the DT tests for `es-abstract`, as it has an `// $ExpectType` for the type of `Promise` which is now wrong because the order of overloads for the static `resolve` method changed in the lib (which is required to pick the correct overload in some cases)."
"So, FWIW, i was saying that roslyn likely almost never needs to use ImmutableDict, and could instead just use a non-mutating view over a normal Dictionary.  I imagine the majority cases are that we don't need clone capabilities, as we likely don't actually do any sort of copy-on-write here.  I may be wrong though.  @github were there particular hostpots where we could benefit from a readonly-dictionary, but also need to clone?"
"> Just so I have a better picture of this, what does the code look like in a single user app that's using blocking waits on thread pool threads parallelism but has enough work to observe problems with limited concurrency?

Many workloads for which tasks were originally introduced, actually.  Consider, for example, parallelized divide and conquer.  A worker partitions its work into multiple pieces, queues identical workers to process N - 1 of those pieces, processes its own, and then waits for those other workers to complete.  Also think about algorithms that require coordination between those pieces, such as various operations used by PLINQ (e.g. OrderBy) that needs to block each of the workers until they reach a common point so that they can exchange data and all continue on, and what would happen if one of the workers was throttled indefinitely.

> OK so a single user application might want to opt out of this

I think that's the wrong direction, at least for the foreseeable future.  **_If_** we decided to go with an approach like the one proposed in this draft, I have trouble seeing it as anything other than opt-in, given all of the previously cited concerns, the potential for introducing deadlocks where they weren't previously, the potential for casting way too wide a net, the potential for negatively impacting the throughput of unrelated workloads, etc.  **_If** such a mitigation was added as opt-in, and if enough testing demonstrated it was a good decision for certain workloads, then it could potentially be automatically opted-in for those, e.g. if you felt ASP.NET should always turn this on.  Even there, though, I'd be surprised if in the current configuration that was a wise choice."
"I think the test failures are unrelated to my changes, please let me know if I'm wrong."
"> The Exception is not bubbled up to host.StartAsync.

I think that behavior is wrong. We should revert it."
"> I guess it means if the profile for callsite's block is wrong  - we're also losing usefull profile of the inlinee?

Yes. Profile data can be ""wrong"" in several different ways.
1.  we might have bugs in our processing that set block counts to zero when they should be nonzero
2. we might be collecting on too narrow of a scenario

Hopefully we find and fix most of the first kind of problem. 

For the second kind we need to be careful not to ""overfit"" to the profile data we have and assume all other behavior is unlikely. The proposal for that is to also run synthesis in tandem, it will give a less extreme view of what is possible at runtime, and then blend the profile data and the synthesized data together. Thus only if both systems agree a block is rare will it end up being rare."
"Thanks for the PR.

I want to make sure I understand what this is trying to fix:
#3525 is about `.deps.json`, but this fix seems to be about `additionalProbingPaths` in `.runtimeconfig.json`. There is some discussion about this in #3525 but it's definitely not the primary purpose of that issue.
So I assume this is trying to fix the fact that `additionalProbingPaths` are relative to current directory and not to the application directory.

As for the change, this could be considered a breaking change, so I don't think it can be done as-is. I can see two possible solutions:
* Add two probing paths if the value is a relative path
  * One where it's resolved against the current directory (current behavior, goes first)
  * One where it's resolved against the application directory (new behavior, goes second)
* Change the behavior only for .NET 6+, in which case the behavior would need to adapt based on the TFM of the app. I think this would be the first time we did something like that in the host, but it might work.

Personally I would probably prefer the second solution - only change this for .NET 6+. I do think that the current behavior is just wrong, so fixing this is great, but we can't break existing apps (Note that this code lives in `hostfxr` which is global, every version of .NET Core on the machine will use the latest `hostfxr`, so we must maintain backward compatibility for this component).

As for the actual code of the change:
* It doesn't compile for me - `GetString` is not a member of `pal::string_t`.
* Resolving relative paths by concatenation is very problematic, at the very least it should use `append_path`
* The code as-is will prepend the directory even to absolute paths, which will break
* The code should use application's directory as the base, not the directory of `.runtimeconfig.json`. While they are typically the same, they don't have to be. I think the correct behavior is for the paths to be relative to the app.
* Additional probing paths can also be specified on the command line. I think the behavior should be the same regardless of which way the probing path was added.
* To accept the change it will need tests to cover the new behavior (and in this case also validate the backward compatibility)"
"The testhost ""wrong"" name is an ordering issue with the properties as the property we depend on was introduced in `Directory.Build.Targets`... @github  any reason why we introduced it in the targets and not the props file here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52897/files#diff-469a3c721b6b95e2cf18fbdd38040bcdf163c0fb04a15f511af71882fc2ae74bR23?

However, it seems like that is not the issue. This ""wrong"" testhost path was introduced in: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52897. However the testhost is being correctly zipped to that location: 
```
Creating directory /home/vsts/work/1/s/artifacts/helix/runtime/

```

So the correlation payload does exist. This seems like perhaps is a break in the helix SDK directly?"

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/57310

This change is fixing a regression from .NET 5.0. The problem happens when trying to create a CultureInfo object using culture names that Windows don't allow. 
This regression occurred during the code refactoring work done to optimize the globalization data size and WASM support.
Although this fix is addressing the regression, it fixes another issue I have discovered during the investigation. Here is what the change is doing:
- In the file `CultureData.Windows.cs`, the condition `ShouldUseUserOverrideNlsData` is wrong to use. The reason is this part of the code is not concerned about the user overrides. Even the user overrides flag is not initialized yet at this stage.
- In the same file, I added the call to Windows API `GetLocaleInfoEx` that help validate the culture name. That is what we have done in .NET 5.0 too.
- In the file `IcuLocaleData.cs`, there was a bug that caused not finding the proper culture name mapping to our data because the culture name containing characters like underscore `_`.
- Fixing and adding tests.

When `SslStreamCertificateContext`  is used on server side, TLS resume is possible and we get ~ 5.5x boost. 
This should get us on par with Windows but I don't have to same machines to verify this. 
On server side #57079 linked the cache to the `SslStreamCertificateContext`. So when server will reuse it it will also provide ability to resume previous session. When the context is Disposed, it will also dispose the SSL_CTX and the cache. 

This creates first complication for client. It also needs to use same `SSL_CTX` but since there is typically no certificate, there is nothing to hook to. 
To solve this I added separate dictionary to hold contexts for client. That allows to reuse previous context and save native allocations. But the native contexts will be preserved during duration of the process. Complete test runs for `SslStream` creates 13 instance, in ideal case there will be one e.g. `SslProtocols.None`. e.g. it depends on unique combinations of `SslProtocols` used by the client. 

To make it more complicated, OpenSSL pushes responsibility for setting the sessions to caller e.g. `SslStream`. 
So we use the `TargetHost` e.g. SNI host to lookup previous session. Since there may be multiple series running on same name this is not perfect. But since this is just offer to the server, it is up to the server to decide if the session is valid or not. Based on my testing, this is how SCHANNEL operates. Some implementations use IP/Port info for the lookup but SslStream does not have access to it in general case. Even with that, this can be just load balancer and the SSL may be terminated or different servers. Once again, if the session is offered to ""wrong"" server or if the server was restored or cleaned up the session, it should proceed with full handshake. 

The rest is mostly technicality. In order to process the sessions, we need to register callbacks and OpenSSL will inform us when it wants to add or remove session. There is some plumbing to map that to .NET and original `TargetHost`.
There can be multiple sessions for given host but the current strategy is to keep the last one. 

I added some methods to SafeSslContextHandle to allocate cache and do operations.  The `GCHandle` can possibly be stored in native SSL_CTX but I felt  it would be easier for debug to keep it on managed side. Since the sessions are not directly used anywhere in managed code, I use `IntPtr` instead of SafeHandle.

"It's a bit subtle that `TryStartActivityFromUri` has that name (`Try...`) yet returns `void`, and that on this branch of the if/else we always return yet on the other we fall through to the base. I'm not suggesting the logic is wrong, just that a year from now, it might be a challenge for us to reason about why it goes like this. The fallthrough structure heightens the risk that we make a change that intends to affect one case but actually affects other cases too.

Would it be viable to do either one or both of the following?

 * Structure the code so there's no fallthrough from one case to another, i.e., that we're in ""HTTP URL"" or ""other scheme URL"" or ""null URL"" mode, and each of those fully encapsulates its own logic and definitely returns (which might involve returning a call to base.ShouldOverrideUrlLoading)
 * Add code comments briefly stating why the choice of whether or not to call base is correct. Perhaps each of the three top-level branches could have a sentence summarizing the reasoning for that case.

Likewise I'm wondering if we should be calling the `ExternalNavigationStarting` event for non-HTTP(S) destinations. My sense is that developers would likely want to have control over such navigations too."

* emit a `GeneratorStart`/`GeneratorStop` event pair using the generator task and op codes
* calculate the run time by diffing the timestamps of the events (the infrastructure should already do this by embedding the duration in the `*Stop` events)

What's currently written should be fine, but would subject the times in the events to any issues the timer has with waking up etc. The times are already being provided by the event infrastructure so you can take advantage of that.

"@github @github Are we sure we'll always call `MarkBackingFieldAsCalculated`? (I think no)

If yes, are we sure it's going to be called only once? Otherwise, I'd need some sort of lock to prevent races causing duplicate diagnostics.

> to report this error into MethodCompiler's bag.

MethodCompiler isn't the only caller. Is there a problem if we always report the diagnostic into the bag given to the `SourcePropertySymbolBase` constructor?

---

> Alternatively, if we don't mind reporting this error per field usage, we could report this check in the binder, where ERR_InterfacesCantContainFields is reported.

I'm more with this approach, but instead of reporting on every field usage. We report once and use the property location, not `field` location.

And even then, we'll have a wrong behavior for initializers where we early create the backing field. This will another check and tests.

@github @github What do you think?"
"Instead of using contextual reflection it would be cleaner to just call `AssemblyLoadContext.GetLoadContext(type.Assembly).LoadFromAssemblyName`.

We recommend people stop using the `Assembly.Load` because of its weird behavior in terms of which ALC it loads into (without contextual reflection it relies on caller's ALC which is often times wrong)."
"> No, the transformation itself looks correct to me (well, there is one issue - `GTF_RELOP_JMP_USED` is not guaranteed to be maintained by this phase, so it'll have to be replaced by a check of the user's oper). It is just happening under conditions that are too lax. `LowerCompare` handles all sorts of relops, so this code will also optimize, e. g. `(x & 1) > 1` to `x & 1`, which is not correct.

I'm going to change `GTF_RELOP_JMP_USED` to
`cmpUse.User()->OperIs(GT_RETURN, GT_STOREIND, GT_STORE_LCL_VAR, GT_STORE_BLK, GT_STORE_OBJ, GT_STORE_LCL_FLD)`.

"I think this is fundamentally the wrong approach here.  If we are worried about this scenario, we need a declarative way for source-generators to say: i need to process semantic models, please call into me to process that along with the other generators that are need the same.

Then, we aren't caching things and potentially blowing memory badly.  And we're not trying to come up with policies around caching that likely will not hold for arbitrary generators.  This last point is especially important.  This sort of approach doesn't work in general as we never really know what sort of caching strategy will work given arbitrary code execution."
"> Doesn't this break applications by removing a public API?

I think it's actually ok.  It's definitely a strange situation, but it's not a source breaking change because recompiling will just bind to the base method of the same signature, and if it were going to be a binary breaking change, it'd already be breaking, because the newslot method doesn't exist in the actual implementation. The base type has the same method name, and the C# compiler emits calls to this in a way where the runtime will end up just calling the base method, even though this has a new slot, e.g. via:
```
callvirt instance string [System.Net.WebHeaderCollection]System.Net.WebHeaderCollection::get_Item(string)
```
or
```
call instance string [System.Net.WebHeaderCollection]System.Net.WebHeaderCollection::get_Item(string)

"> does jit need an ability to deoptimize methods...?

Good question. Profile based optimizations rely on the past being a good predictor of the future. So any sort of profiling scheme is vulnerable to the profile not accurately representing future behavior.

We are using Tier0 to collect counts because it was fairly easy to set up, and provided an easy way to get profile data into the jit, so we could start improving the ways the jit uses profile data. But as you note, that means we only get to observe the first few calls for some methods. It remains to be seen how well (or poorly) this predicts future behavior in general.

I think we will get around to deopt eventually, as we start making stronger bets based on profile data and need the ability to reconsider and reoptimize if we have bet wrong. I don't know if we'd deopt because of poor block layout, though -- I was imagining it would be more for things like guarded (or unguarded) speculative devirtualization."

"So interestingly, this seems to mean that JITing on arm64 in MacCatalyst apps is not possible.

Do all live range coalescing in genSetScopeInfoUsingVariableRanges to
make sure we catch as many cases as possible. In particular, we were not
coalescing ranges opened in the prolog with other ranges before.

The old logic also seemed incorrect: the end of live var ranges is
exclusive (the comment on it was wrong) which meant that the old logic
would coalesce two ranges that were separated by one instruction. This
means the new logic has more accurate reporting. However, the diff is
still negative because coalescing ranges from the prolog looks to be
more important: on my machine, SPC decreases in size by around 10 KB
from this change.

(Correct me if I'm wrong) It looks like you only set these in the constructor. Why not just make them `constexpr` in the namespace?
"The two code paths behave very different in these details. That's why I baked the exception handling into the member acessors.
Reflection does not throw a NRE when a method with value-typed parameter is called with argument null. So there is nothing to catch - Reflection.Emit throws NRE in this case.
Reflection throws ArgumentException when value is not assignable - Reflection.Emit throws InvalidCastException.

Bringing all these details about the member accessor implementation to the level where the delegate is called seems wrong to me.

As with the _Xterm_ scheme you can see some ""glitches"" in the 16-color mappings. Only now even the colors are wrong. For example, it thinks the _Solarized_ dark green is closer to a shade of yellow, and the blue looks more like cyan. But again, I don't think that is such a big deal - it's still mapping to a reasonable color.

The unexpected ""black"" spots are worse though. That's because those are colors that appear to be a medium shade of gray, and thus get mapped to index 8 (bright black), but in the _Solarized_ scheme, bright black is the darkest color in the palette, darker even than dark black. Without knowing the palette, there's nothing we can do about that.

And then you've also got the fact that half of the bright colors are just shades of gray. So the bright greens and yellows in the rightmost blocks of the color cube end up getting mapped to various shades of gray. But note that the original algorithm didn't do much better, with those greens and yellows being mapped to red, orange and blue.

Finally there are the shades of gray at the bottom of the test pattern where the middle section appears darker than the start. But again that's just because _Solarized_ has the black and bright black intensities reversed. The mapping in the old algorithm wasn't perfect either, but the shades of gray are at least in the right order.

So yeah, this case is a bit of a mess for the new algorithm, but that's not a huge surprise. And if you're using a _Solarized_ color scheme, then you're probably used to things being broken a lot of the time. 😉"

I was playing with it today and it's a mixed bag situation.

First of all, the `SecKeyCreateWithData` API documentation states that it requires `kSecAttrKeySizeInBits` which is not true. The implementation doesn't look at it, never looked at it (as far as the published sources go), and even omits it in many of their own regression tests. It's much simpler to use when this is not required. I filed an Apple Feedback to clarify the situation.

Second, it does seem to work for RSA keys even with the item export. On ECC though it hits the problematic code paths in the native code which explain the issues you've hit.

I'll submit a PR later to convert the RSA code paths to use it.

By default, `LocalAppData` is undefined on Unix, the following line will actually reference to a file named `\NCLTest.Socket.SendPacketsAsync.testpayload` in the working directory of the test execution process:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/a8c2d1eae1726b1e6ec50716b7d4c34bc21ba96e/src/libraries/System.Net.Sockets/tests/FunctionalTests/SendPacketsAsync.cs#L23

On CI it's a known folder so the path points to stuff like `/private/tmp/helix/working/A48D0921/w/C66409E5/e/System.Net.Sockets.Tests.app/Contents/Resources/\NCLTest.Socket.SendPacketsAsync.testpayload` on Helix Macs. I'm not sure what goes wrong with the access to the above folder, but I believe it's better to use the preferred `TempFile` utility to create temporary files, and this change will likely fix the `UnauthorizedAccessException`, since other tests using `TempFile` seem to be healthy right now.

Also changing the test to use the standard xunit test output instead of the legacy `TestLogging.GetInstance()`.

"> Does this need to be applied to the Pem ones as well?

Per local testing, disabling just these two types (ultimately the base class that powers them) was enough.  It'll get CI off the floor and let my compatriots in the OS group figure out what went wrong."
"> @github when I made the initial [proposal](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/69320#issuecomment-1133587458)

I think you are talking about this :
```
while (true)
{
    T? item;
    if (TryTakeWithNoTimeValidation(out item, Timeout.Infinite, cancellationToken, linkedTokenSource))
    {
        yield return item;
    }
    else
    {
        break;
    }
}
```

I did not follow the initial proposal, because (correct me if I'm wrong) your proposal assumes that when there is no element to take, `GetConsumingEnumerable` should end, whereas the actual code retry taking another element untill adding is complete

The thread could still get preempted. A developer could block too long in a custom IConnectionHeartbeatFeature callback. We could introduce a deadlock. There are a bunch of reasons we should still time OnHeartbeat() and log ""heartbeatslow"" if it takes over a second.

I agree that ""heartbeatslow"" warnings are likely more often caused because bunch of timer callbacks get dequeued in rapid succession as the threadpool works through a backlog of work items, but what's the harm in timing OnHeartbeat()? Are we sure that already-dequeued timer callback *never* gets preempted by the OS for over a second? What's wrong with logging something if and when this does happen?

"> Determined by the caller. The one case in initial binding which still potentially passes true here though is when the nullable type is used explicitly in code. I assume, possibly wrong, that it should generate warnings in that case. 

Yes, that feels inconsistent with other similar places where we report warnings outside of NullableWalker. Like for example in SourceMemberContainerSymbol_ImplementationChecks.cs, SourceComplexParameterSymbol.cs, TypeSymbol.cs, etc.
We can easily check the language version here in the way the first iteration did it.

I also experimented with a class implementing `IMethodSymbol` and calls to `ISymbolDisplayService` and `IDocumentationCommentFormattingService` but that ended up being too involved. So I decided to copy the `TaggedText[]` of the decimal and use that as a starting point.

It lacks the following features:
* The classification of source and target type as `keyword` is wrong for `Enums`
* The description is a bit misleading. It describes the operator method, but it would be more useful to describe the conversion itself, like ""Explicit cast from int to byte"".
* The description should not contain *of a* and *to a* to avoid grammar issues with type names starting with a vowel.
* Needs to be localized.
* Is `Environment.NewLine` correct here?
* It incorporates the nullable question mark in the method signature `int.explicit operator byte?(int value)` which looks odd (either no ? should be given (that is what user-defined operators do) or both types should have a ?)

Given, that the idea to create the `CompletionDescription` out of `TaggedText` is the right way to go here, I would like to change the description text and localize it."

"This code appears to correctly modify the array so that there is a single applicable member when overload resolution succeeds. However, when there is more than one most specific candidate, this code may leave in the array some members marked as applicable even though some other member may be more specific (I think). We do have a way of seeing the candidate set through a public API in `SemanticModel` (I think). So it appears we may yield the wrong result in that particular case.

In the case that there is more than one most specific candidate (which will result in an error), I don't mind having the quadratic loop to precisely limit the set of candidates and eliminate those for which there is some more specific candidate. We could still have the code be fast in the non-error case, which is by far more common.

All of this is theory. I would ask @github to please either tell my why my theory is wrong, or craft a test that confirms my suspicion (by having a set of user-defined overloaded operators in a class hierarchy, an ambiguous use of the operator, and using `SemanticModel` to see the not-quite-correct overload set). And if I was right, I think the code should be adjusted, in the more-than-one-candidate case, to eliminate candidates for which some other method is more specific.

"Thanks for providing more feedback. Yes that seems to be happening, and I do agree we need to somehow hack it in that when the editor ""gets focus"" such that not too much is read out. We can aslo ask on NVDA github page for ideas how to potentially achieve this.
Also if we move paramter hints to also use `activeDescendetes` we will have the same issue, once the paremeterHints get closed the editor aria label we get re-read.

A crazy idea which I have and I am not sure if it will work is that we set `ariaHidden=true` on the editor instead of cleaning out its ariaLabel. The focus goes back to the editor, nothing gets read out and after a timeout we remove this `ariaHidden` attribute. That would sort of make the editor invisible to the screen reader for a very brief perioud of time.

For other fixes: no problem, no need for appologies :)"

"(This is a much larger discussion that doesn't have to be implemented as a part of this PR. So really I'm thinking out loud.)
I'm wondering if we should move `TerminalSettings` over to TerminalSettingsModel. Hear me out:
- if we're making `TerminalSettings` `IInheritable`, might as well move `TerminalSettings` over to TSM. It's a bit weird for us to grab this random file from a separate project, right? haha
- With regards to creating a TermControl preview in Settings UI...
  - I hit a problem today. TSE cannot depend on TermApp because that'd create a circular dependency (TermApp <--> TSE). So I tried making it so that TSE builds a `TerminalSettings` by firing an event to TermApp, but then TermApp would need to somehow get the synthesized `TerminalSettings` object down to the profile page _and_ update on each change. Having `TerminalSettings` be its own project or a part of TSM makes it it so much easier to construct `TerminalSettings` and just have one readily available for a TermControl preview.

What do you think?

CC @github for thoughts on this matter too. I might just be approaching the two things above completely wrong haha"

The concept of a ""larger scope"" for a type parameter probably needs a clear definition. And I think the suggested fix can esily be adjusted to ignore type parameters like that. However, if we are talking about method type parameters that are becoming type type parameters, then, perhaps, the ""after the substitution"" is the important part in the suggestion.

"> Many workloads for which tasks were originally introduced, actually. Consider, for example, parallelized divide and conquer. A worker partitions its work into multiple pieces, queues identical workers to process N - 1 of those pieces, processes its own, and then waits for those other workers to complete. Also think about algorithms that require coordination between those pieces, such as various operations used by PLINQ (e.g. OrderBy) that needs to block each of the workers until they reach a common point so that they can exchange data and all continue on, and what would happen if one of the workers was throttled indefinitely

Today do the implementation of those kick end up doing Task.Wait?

> I think that's the wrong direction, at least for the foreseeable future. If we decided to go with an approach like the one proposed in this draft, I have trouble seeing it as anything other than opt-in, given all of the previously cited concerns, the potential for introducing deadlocks where they weren't previously, the potential for casting way too wide a net, the potential for negatively impacting the throughput of unrelated workloads, etc. _If such a mitigation was added as opt-in, and if enough testing demonstrated it was a good decision for certain workloads, then it could potentially be automatically opted-in for those, e.g. if you felt ASP.NET should always turn this on. Even there, though, I'd be surprised if in the current configuration that was a wise choice.

Yes I have similar fears but I'm looking for solutions. Maybe this isn't this one but there are aspects of this that seem interesting. Say we added a public API to enable this and it was opt-in, I could see the potential for adding a piece of middleware or filters that enables this on the current workitem before the blocking code executed. Something like this:

```C#
[HttpGet(""/blocking"")]
[EnableBlockingMitigation] // This name is terrible
public string BlockingLegacyCodez()
{
      return new WebClient().DownloadString(...); // I know we're never supposed to use this API
}
```

That filter could yield to thread pool to get off the current work item and enable mitigation on a unique workitem that's closer to this code. The equivalent of doing this:

```C#
[HttpGet(""/blocking"")]
public async Task<string> BlockingLegacyCodez()
{
      await Task.Yield(); // Make a new work item
      ThreadPool.EnableBlockingWorkitem();
      return new WebClient().DownloadString(...); // I know we're never supposed to use this API
}
```

"> > The Exception is not bubbled up to host.StartAsync.

> I think that behavior is wrong. We should revert it.

@github - In looking at this again - an `Exception` thrown from a `BackgroundService` was only ever bubbled up to `host.StartAsync` when it was [thrown from](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/50569/files#diff-3f578e113b4e83fd5fe9e0073a4ebdd6230895dfc7429b058c26d6bb5fb47849L65):

```csharp
// Fire IHostedService.Start
await hostedService.StartAsync(combinedCancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);
```

Otherwise it was just logged in `HandleBackgroundException`. I believe that this was probably extremely rare, and I wouldn't be surprised if most errors [occurred in](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/50569/files#diff-3f578e113b4e83fd5fe9e0073a4ebdd6230895dfc7429b058c26d6bb5fb47849L79-L87):

```csharp
await backgroundService.ExecuteTask.ConfigureAwait(false);
```

Since it is possible for an error to occur on either call, I intentionally grouped these two together to capture both possible background service failure scenarios. Are you suggesting that we `throw` from within the `TryStartBackgroundServiceAsync`? If so, why bother calling `StopApplication`?

I'm still a bit confused on why we wouldn't call `StopAsync` in the `catch` clause in the `TryStartBackgroundServiceAsync` method.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/53362

This change is fixing the wrong behavior of the Culture Native and Display names. We had the following behavior:
- Display names were cached which is wrong. The display names should be treated as the localized resources and should be retrieved every time using the CurrentUICulture.
- There is some old special case for supplemental culture which is not applying anymore because Windows already using supplemental culture LCID values for some of its built-in cultures. 
- When requesting the native or display names using ICU, if ICU couldn't find a suitable resource for the request, it just return the culture name e.g. `en-US instead of English (United States) ` which is not suitable to use in the UI apps.

The fix here is doing the following:

- For display names now, we use CurrentUICulture to retrieve the name.
- Removed the supplemental culture special case. 
- When requesting the display and native names from ICU, we fallback to English names if couldn't find resources for the requested culture. 
- Added some test

"> @github can you please take a look at the Fuzzlyn-arm64 failure, is it worth investigating?

I've seen it a few times, I don't think it's related to this PR. Seems like either Fuzzlyn can generate extremely large structures or something else is wrong. It's probably the former."
"> I'm not against an internal abstraction here if it helps more than it hurts, but I'm not seeing it at the moment. You mention this will help better address future issues; can you elaborate?

3 things come to mind:

1. There's a reqeuest from the OpenXML team to bring back the `ZipArchive.Flush` method that we didn't port from .NET Framework. The API would unblock some problems they found in System.IO.Packaging APIs. I experimented with adding a `Flush` method, and realized that the behavior would have to be special-cased depending on the mode. `Flush` would do exactly what we currently do inside `Dispose`, minus the disposal of the internal streams. But since the expectation is that the user should be able to continue manipulating the archive and entries after they call `Flush`, then we need to put the streams back into a good state, and this is where I was finding the complications due to the read/create/updaet logic being intermixed.
2. `ZipArchive` also has different behaviors when loading the archive and the entries, which depend on the mode. It would be quite helpful to have a separation of the logic depending on the mode, if we want to fix the memory-related issues (linked in the description).
3. Finally, if we want to add zip64 support, I imagine we would have to split the code even more. I haven't dug deep into this, but my first impression is that this could be another layer of abstraction if we use the strategy pattern (I could be wrong).

> I generally agree with @github here; I'm not seeing what this abstraction is really buying. 

A good alternative @github gave me is to add specialized methods instead, and split the methods into partial files depending on the method. I like the option since I don't have strong arguments for points 2 and 3 yet. So until I can confirm we have an additional abstraction layer besides `ZipArchiveMode` that would require a strategy pattern, we can stick to partial files.

How does that sound?"
"> I think there was more utility back when we thought we would have multi-RDN value support.

Yeah, but we have the wrong shape for that.  The one multi-valued test we have (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/e74c3e812fa5c96dc7ebaff655bff8820f3f9a62/src/libraries/System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates/tests/X500DistinguishedNameTests.cs#L23-L33) shows the encoding:

```

  SET (2 elem)
    SEQUENCE (2 elem)

      PrintableString James
    SEQUENCE (2 elem)
      OBJECT IDENTIFIER 2.5.4.10 organizationName (X.520 DN component)
      PrintableString Microsoft
```

If it was a multi-RDN escape hatch then we'd've had just `AddEncoded` which required the input to be a SET( OF).

> I suppose AddEncoded could be removed under the same pretense that multi-RDN was removed: you are doing something interesting / unique and you can probably just use AsnWriter.

Yeah.  Let's just cut it.  If we remember why we wanted it it's easy enough to add back (and already API-Approved)"

"I don't think passing in 1000 endpoints here is viable whether we pre-sort them or not. You're asking us to iterate 1000 endpoints multiple times and process policies on all of them. At that point you're holding it wrong.

"I think the reason we didn't `try`/`catch` this before was that we expected that, if any of the `Dispose` calls throws, then that's going to bubble up to be an unhandled exception on the renderer, which is fatal and will dispose everything (including all components) anyway.

Was that reasoning wrong? Could you clarify why?"
"One other sticking point is that there's no guarantee that the same algorithm is used to compute the hash code of a `string` vs. the hash code of a `ReadOnlySpan<char>`. In fact, `Dictionary<string, ...>` _throws away_ the default comparer and uses a specialized string comparer for greater performance. It's definitely solvable, but doing this in a manner that won't regress performance of _existing_ scenarios is a much more complex problem than it appears.

Edit: The reason this matters is that the hash code is needed to compute which bucket the key maps to. If we inadvertently compute the wrong hash code, we could end up in a situation where the dictionary truly does contain some `string` value but we say it doesn't contain the equivalent `ROS<char>` value."
"Wouldn't doing it on a `finally` block the CircuitHost achieve the same result? If something went wrong with the previous call, we should fail and tear-down the circuit, shouldn't we?"
"This seems wrong to me.  THe idea behind this type is that it's long lived, and unbound to any particular cancellation exception we might have gotten for some operation (like the ones we create during 'add using').  If we don't have this cancellation token, and we now use an ambient cancellatoin token passed in by a feature, we will make it so that this type is no longer long lived, and no longer sits patiently in its loop, updating the index on its prescribed schedule."
"The justification is that the implementation is incorrect, and the test carefully tests only one case for which the incorrect implementation happens to work. If you test the existing implementation on a random sequence of data it will be wrong more than 1000 times for every time it gets it right.

The escaping logic in the compilers is today computed on a character-by-character basis. There is not enough information from a single surrogate character to determine whether or not escaping it is necessary, so escaping it is the only correct approach without considering more context.

It might be worth changing the escaping logic by making it more complex such that it scans the sequence of characters and considers each character in the context of the characters that precede it and follow it to determine if escaping is necessary. I don't think that is worth the effort.

If somebody were to change the type `_GetModifier` accepts, all this code would silently continue working (so long as the type it accepts meets `sizeof(T) == sizeof(size_t)`) but produce the wrong value.

"`Contract` ""blows up"", meaning we get an actual failure (and watson etc.) so that we know we did something wrong and have to go fix it.   A null check like this masks a logic bug in our code, which can then manifest as broken behavior for users thatw e have no insight on what actually went wrong.  

In general, if something indicates a logic bug in our code, we do not try to be resilient to it.  Rather, we fail early and report the NFW so we can actionably address teh scenario.  This approach is born out by enumerable experiences trying to go the ""be resilient and just trudge along"" route, and how much extra cost that has given us over the years as we've attempted to track down failures and intermittent behavior for users."

"> That might just be a case of ""play stupid games, win stupid prizes"".

That is how I am thinking of this feature. There are cases where the compiler can definitely determine if the user is doing something wrong, but also where it _might_ be doing something wrong. The [`Span<T>.ToArray()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.span-1.toarray) is another example. If a user calls `ToArray()` and `T` is known to be ByRefLike, the compiler could issue a failure. However, if `T` isn't know at compile time then it would be up to the implementer to have handled this appropriately using something like the proposed intrinsi-fication of `typeof(T.).IsByRefLike` in this document. The updated `Span<T>.ToArray()` would look as follows and handle the case at runtime. The other APIs in question would have similar checks.

```diff
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
public T[] ToArray()
{
+    if (typeof(T).IsByRefLike)
+        throw new InvalidProgramException();

    if (_length == 0)
        return Array.Empty<T>();

    var destination = new T[_length];
    Buffer.Memmove(ref MemoryMarshal.GetArrayDataReference(destination), ref _pointer.Value, (uint)_length);
    return destination;
}
```"
The name of this test method is now wrong. But can we just delete these tests now?
">dateTime = dateTime.AddMicroseconds(microsecond); [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=16&length=49)

This is wrong. imaging users passing microseconds equal -10 for example. this should throw but with this code possibly will not throw. 

You need to manually test microseconds, like:

```C#

if ((uint)microsecond >= MicrosecondsPerMillisecond) 
{
    Throw...
}

var dateTime = calendar.ToDateTime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond);
_dateData = dateTime.AddMicroseconds(microsecond)._dateData; // Note, it is wrong to assign _dateData to UTicks.

"So, if the programmer omits a type annotation on a `this` parameter, you will think there was _no_ `this` parameter and get your parameter count adjustments wrong below. You need to track the presence of a this parameter separately from its type. When the type annotation is missing you should use `unknownType`. Also, you can just use `getTypeFromTypeNode(param.type)` instead of `getTypeOfSymbol`.

I've also consolidated the various different hex encoding/decoding implementations across the libraries to the ones in the internal common class `HexConverter` (25d222e). If you'd like to see those kinds of changes in a separate PR, then I'll revert it in this branch.
If we decide to merge this PR as is (after re-review of course) then there are only very few hex encoding/decoding implementations left. Those are not consolidated here because they:
- are used by projects that still target pre-`Span<T>` TFMs
- do more than just hex encoding/decoding (e.g. handle octal strings as well)
- are in test code and adding including `HexConverter` to test projects felt ""wrong""

"I would file a new issue (as this is the wrong place to discuss it), but I'm not sure that we do anything special for a method bound like that. Check out the `d.ts` file output given in your example; the method's type is identical whether or not the constructor reassigns it.

This fix fixes a bug that was on all platforms that we just hadn’t noticed. The previous code was semantically wrong in all cases and just happened to work.
"> Currently, we wait for these descendants only when the user does not provide any timeout value, meaning that the user can wait up to infinity. I don't believe that this behavior should be changed. It's by design.

By design means this is intentional.
If a user kills a process, why would he then want to wait up to infinity to read its output?

This is how I came to making this PR:

msbuild has some code like this:

```cs
process.Kill();
bool exited = process.WaitForExit(timeout);
```

The timeout is here to avoid the the infinite wait when a grand child still holds the terminal.

The msbuild repo also had a long standing open issue where things went wrong for an unclear reason that was hard to reproduce.

The root cause was a bug in the `exited` `false` path, which was very unlikely, but not impossible, to occur."
"@github The problem is not the lifetime of the strings themselves, the problem is the life-time of the objects allocated between these forever live objects.

# What might go wrong?

Let's say you have a scenario where you do something like this.

JIT a method (and therefore allocates some string literals on POH)
run some code (and therefore allocates maybe some objects on POH), and then
JIT another method (and therefore allocates some string literals on POH)

The POH will look like this.

```
...[string-from-method-1][object1][object2][string-from-method-2][string-from-method-2]...
```

The strings from methods never go away, so they are stuck. By themselves, they don't cause fragmentation. The problem is that object 1 and object 2 might not be needed anymore. Currently, we need a gen2 to eliminate them, so if there is an object 3 allocation before that gen 2 GC happens, it won't be fit in that location. Even after the gen 2 GC, those holes might be small and won't fit future allocation, and that space is practically done and be wasted forever. The fact that we need to wait until the next gen2 GC makes it less than ideal if we use it as if it is malloc/free.

> Opportunity - does it make sense to enable a user to free a managed object so that it gets into the free list right away for LOH/POH objects without having to wait until the next gen 2?

That also explains why it is a really bad idea for collectible assemblies. When a collectible assembly is unloaded, all the associated strings will be eligible for collection, and the collection will create lots of tiny holes (most strings are probably error messages, maybe 200 bytes or less?). We can imagine it would be hard to reuse those holes.

# How do I fix it?

One way to optimize POH utilization is to make sure all objects allocated there are long-lived. Either they are actually being used (like the strings), or they are pooled so that we reuse them instead of creating holes and allocates again. 

> Opportunity - does it make sense to have a single shared pool of pinned buffer allocated on the POH so that could be reused by all libraries that need pinned buffers? 

Another way to optimize for POH utilization is to allocate objects of similar lifetimes together in time. So that we can create a big hole when they go away, and a big free list block is much more likely to be reusable.

> Opportunity - does it make sense to enable a user to manually specify a collection of objects to have a similar lifetime so that we don't allocate others with a different lifetime in the same (segment/regions)?

This is not backed by experiment yet, this is just speculation. I hope this clarifies what @github meant by _when_."
I was unable to figure out what's wrong yet. I cannot get access to the lab machines and this change works fine on both of my local macs (x64 and arm64).
"The `Maestro auto-merge - Do not automerge downgrades` is wrong, there's no actual downgrade. Tracked by https://github.com/dotnet/core-eng/issues/13967"
I think we may be leading users in the wrong direction by including the file path.
"> Hmm - that's odd. I would have expected the app to exit. I don't think this is a mode that we should fall back into.

I agree with @github. The behavior should be deterministic and not surprising to the users. In genral, we always fail fast if anything goes wrong. This gives the user the user to know what is wrong and fix it instead of having the user experience multiple failures during the runtime. We'll need to have a failure message be clear though. "
Here and below... Just throw. No need for clever things later on. The path was probably wrong.
"It’s important because caching the wrong version of a file is bad - you can’t easily recover from that without manually clearing caches, which is impossible to explain to most end users. The hash check protects users from this situation, so at worst they can reload the page to recover. 

Consider visiting the site at the same moment that a new version is being deployed. Half the assemblies are the old versions, then the second half comes from the new versions. This likely means a broken app, or at least undefined behaviour. Without the hash check this combination of files would get cached and that user would be stuck with the errors. With the hash check, the initial load fails which is good as it prevents the undefined behaviour, then on the next visit the user gets and caches a working state. 

Same general situation if you have multiple front end servers and no client affinity. If you’re incrementally rolling out updates, we want to detect the case where you load an inconsistent set of resources because the requests were handled by an incompatible collection of servers. "

This would not be a good option going forward though. VSCode itself is exploring to enable a sandbox option from Electro that prevents any node.js code to be executed in the window. My hope was that the work you do can benefit both web and the future sandboxed desktop environment. I would want this solution to support all encodings in both web and sandboxed desktop if possible. If there is a reason we cannot support this for some encodings, we should understand why that is and come up with a custom solution if possible. I thought that `iconv-lite` through webpack would support all encodings because there are no native dependencies, but please correct me if that assumption was wrong. E.g. if we need node.js for the UTF-16 conversion, we should try to write our own converter if possible.

> Is loading from file system crucial for us when testing nativeTextFileService?

Yeah I think for desktop I would like to preserve that because it will test the actual stack down to the disk. However, we have a way to register file system providers and we could simply swap out the disk based provider with an in-memory one here:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b8f63e9ebeaee7f6117476bb52abb270bed32adb/src/vs/workbench/services/textfile/test/electron-browser/textFileService.io.test.ts#L54

In other words, all those tests could run fine in web if the file system provider registered is one that is in-memory for web. For example we have one here:

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/b8f63e9ebeaee7f6117476bb52abb270bed32adb/src/vs/platform/files/common/inMemoryFilesystemProvider.ts#L53

> It looks like AbstractTextFileService only uses what is defined in common, but itself is in browser. > Is it intentional? Should it be moved to common?

It cannot move currently due to:

If we call `init_logging_categories()` *twice* -- once in `JNI_OnLoad()` and once here -- then existing functionality is retained, while also allowing ""global"" state to be used before `Java_mono_android_Runtime_init()` is invoked.

It should also be safe to call `init_logging_categories()` twice; at least, I don't see anything obviously wrong with doing so."

I am consuming this change in the latest version of Visual Studio Preview 17.3. Preview 1.1 using Maui (.NET 6).

I can confirm that the test using the badssl website with self-signed certificate works and gets correctly bypassed, thanks for the change!

In fact, every common certificate problem they have in their website works with the validation callback bypassing cert errors, except for the [wrong host example](https://wrong.host.badssl.com/)

This scenario, along with all others, were working before, but this particular one is, unfortunately, a blocker for me. I believe you will be able to repro it on your side as well by attempting to access that URL.

Follows the exception I get after using the validation callback to bypass the certificate errors in the wrong host website from badssl:

"I considered that but for now decided against it. It's not inherently wrong to ask for a key on a non-deterministic build, we just have to meet the contract that it never compares equal. I also worried that it would create friction points for consumers where they have to keep taking different paths whether a specific option was passed to the compiler. 

I actually started wondering if the opposite was needed. Essentially make the output deterministic even if the options weren't deterministic. Consider the C# IDE case as motivation for this. They are trying to determine equivalence between open / closing the IDE and remote sessions. That shouldn't all fall apart if the customer didn't use deterministic builds. It also seems odd to call `WithDeterminism(true)` before calling the API. Possible better to just ignore that option in the output.

"> Why does this not apply to all of the other fixers and refactorings we offer?

It's my opinion here that this is a very rare, but explicit, trigger that indicates the user intends to use a file-scoped-namespace.  The trigger specificity, and the lack of overlap with any other constructs means we can specialize this as something explicit we do.

>Also, why doesn't this logic apply to the two namespaces, or nested namespaces scenario? If the reasoning is ""the user typed a semicolon, they must want file scoped namespaces"", then why not also just convert the first namespace in the file, and the user can move the second one to another file afterwards?

This is a good question.  Primarily I was concerned about actually breaking code and putting the user in a space that they didn't know how to fix.  Namely that they then might trigger ""move to file"" and things might go wrong because it would take the new *nested* interpretation instead of hte original sibling interpretation.

We also checked the C# repos we have access to and found that ""single namespace + type"" is the 99.9 case (i think 99.97), so it felt this was hitting a reasonable sweet spot here :)"

Am I wrong?
"Also, correct me if I'm wrong but passing in a ref to a the cached behavior should be safe even in multi-threading scenarios since even if two threads happen to try to evaluate the case behavior they would have both set it to the same value so I believe concurrency should not be a concern AFAIK"
"Oh! Red alert! Two things:
1. @github: The schema correctly shows the values of the SuppressionStates enumeration as ""suppressed"", ""suppressedInSource"". But the code gen hints file gives the enumeration constant names as ""SuppressedInSource"", ""SuppressedInBaseline"", so the generated file SuppressionStates.cs is wrong. I'll fix that.
2. @github: The interpretation of the SuppressionStates enum is subtle. Every result that is suppressed, for whatever reason, should have the value ""suppressed"" in the ""suppressionStates"" array. Those results that are suppressed because of an in-source suppression should _also_ have the value ""suppressedInSource"" in the array. I can explain offline the reasoning behind that.

So, since in Roslyn every suppression you see is a source-level suppression (that's right, isn't it?) your code should be

```
            _writer.WriteArrayStart(""suppressionStates"");
            _writer.Write(""suppressed"");
            _writer.Write(""suppressedInSource"");
```

... resulting in

```
            ""suppressionStates"": [ ""suppressed"", ""suppressedInSource"" ]
```

However, I have a `System.Memory` test that fails reliably on x86 with my PR build.  That particular test only makes use of `BitOperations.TrailingZeroCount`, and disabling BMI1 does switch the TZCNT to BSF as expected... then it fails in exactly the same way.

I tried running a jit-diff against the base of my branch, but I get an error about the JIT being the wrong version (is that because of the GUID change?).  Running the test with COMPlus_JitDisasm, the jitted code is identical right up to the point the baseline completes the test and the PR build throws an exception.

<hr />

Three bugs being fixed here:
1. The SlideCursorToStartOfBuffer method is incorrectly assuming that the buffer is filled to its end (that m_Buffer.Length = m_CharsRead).  As a result, two things happen.  First, we copy more data than is needed to the temporary buffer; that's just unnecessary but not harmful.  But second, when it issues a read to fill the remainder of the buffer, it does so at the wrong position, both leaving zeros in the buffer that end up getting parsed as real data and losing real data from the end.
2. IncreaseBufferSize assumes m_CharsRead = m_Buffer.Length, which may not be the case.  As with (1), this can result in it reading into the wrong part of the array and leaving garbage that gets processed.
3. IncreaseBufferSize is always increasing the buffer size, even if only a small portion of the buffer is used.  This can then result in the whole operation failing when it repeatedly increases the buffer size and ends up failing due to ticking over the max buffer threshold.

(1) doesn't exist in .NET Framework 4.8 but (2) and (3) do.  (1) is easily triggered by a stream that sporadically doesn't produce all the data requested; (2) and (3) end up needing a stream that frequently produces much less than requested.  This PR fixes all three.

Without the fixes included, here is how the tests being added here fail on main:

"@github, I am encountering a weird issue in our CI testing.

Right now, this PR includes a couple of changes where I intentionally crash or return a wrong return code in some tests. The goal is simply to make sure the tests are actually run and validated.

I tried a few times, but I just can't make a GC test to fail the CI. The tests are supposed to fail on every platform, but it doesn't. If I ran the generated cmd file locally it fails locally."
"> what functionality should we expect from the file system in WASM? I assume setting permissions is expected to fail and such tests should skip there?

It seems to be partially supported. See [FS.chmod(path, mode)](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#FS.chmod):

`The underlying implementation does not support user or group permissions. The caller is always treated as the owner of the folder, and only permissions relevant to the owner apply.`

[FS.open(path, flags[, mode])](https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/Filesystem-API.html#FS.open):
`The underlying implementation does not support user or group permissions. The file permissions set in mode are only used if the file is created. The caller is always treated as the owner of the file, and only those permissions apply.`

Am I crazy? It doesn't look like it's actually possible for `builder` to be null here.
Have trouble believing the previous `Exclude` item was wrong. Instead the ref/ project shouldn't provide metadata in `@(ReferencePathWithRefAssemblies)`.
"Yeah, I mixed up the extensions. Using signalr.client.java.Tests.javaproj would also have been wrong❔ Please file an issue to ship that.

So it might be doable to add the NativeContent item to UpToDateCheckInput after RAR/design-time RAR. @github, that might be worth clarifying in that doc.

@github yes, you can modify the set of `UpToDateCheckInput/Output/Built` items via the targets specified in those docs. We use design-time build data for that.

I'm unclear on the clarification you're after though.

> I'm confused by ""Note that UpToDateCheckOutput exists but is deprecated and only maintained for backwards compatability."" in the docs.

@github I know you edited this, but regardless: you're right, this is confusing. I've removed mention of the deprecation in https://github.com/dotnet/project-system/pull/7840. Technically `UpToDateCheckOutput` is redundant, but in practice it's less confusing to allow its use, and we can't remove it anyway.

> Hmm I've just realized it's the VS build, not command-line, it's harder to get a decent binlog that involves both projects. Not sure how to investigate this. If you keep building, does it still rebuild every time?

"Ah, you're right: this is the wrong repo.

My goal: I'm writing an NPM package for [multiplexing streams](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerdbank-streams) to work as a companion to your vscode-jsonrpc package. I already have it defined in a .NET library and of course I want cancellation support. I certainly do not want to redefine cancellation tokens as your package has already done it. My package does not require JSON-RPC itself, but it depends on vscode-jsonrpc the package in order to get cancellation tokens. But I need the functionality that this PR adds (albeit to the wrong repo) to be complete.

So it seems I should close this PR and open one against the right repo. And if you'd entertain the idea, perhaps I can start a new repo with all your cancellation token code in it as a new package, then send a PR to this and/or the vscode-languageserver-node repo to consume the new one so you have just one code base for cancellation tokens.

"@github I guess I can't figure out anymore how I originally fixed the issue. 😐
Due to that I'll now add a special handling for `^@` using the old and proven test for `vkey == VkKeyScanW(0)`.

One quick question regarding this PR though: Should I revert my addition of `ToUnicodeEx`?
It's benefit is that it can properly handle shift keys. For instance this PR can differentiate between:
* <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+.</kbd> which yields `^[^.` and
* <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Shift+.</kbd> which yields `^[^:`

The current solution with `MapVirtualKeyW` only supports the unshifted character `.`.
Another benefit is that after merging this PR we can remove _all_ of [this special handling altogether](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/ea1bb2ed9359fcc6ded32ad11a8cab544b91ae0e/src/terminal/input/terminalInput.cpp#L347-L416).
Since `ToUnicodeEx` supports Shift we can now use this to easily differentiate between `Ctrl+Alt+/` and `Ctrl+Alt+?` as well. All of the `VkKeyScanW` based code can thus be removed.

But the downside to the `ToUnicodeEx` based solution is that it changes the current behavior slightly:
When you now press <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+A</kbd> it'll technically generate `^[^a` (i.e. lowercase ""a"").
Due to [the way Ctrl masking works](https://garbagecollected.org/2017/01/31/four-column-ascii/) I _believe_ that all currently supported Ctrl+Alt combinations should produce the same output as they did before though.

What are your thoughts about this?
I'd personally go ahead with `ToUnicodeEx` because it supports the Shift key and it allows us to clean up `_searchWithModifier` later on. But since I'm not familiar with MS internals, I cannot properly estimate what the risk factor for getting something wrong in this component and changing existing behavior is."

">nonOutConstructorCall is not BoundObjectCreationExpression { ResultKind: LookupResultKind.Viable } [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=16&length=98)

This approach feels somewhat fragile because we have no idea what went wrong and whether we would prefer reporting the errors rather than trying to bind with an additional out argument. For example, what if the only reason the attempt failed is a missing assembly reference? Should we instead ask to add the reference, or move to the second form? I assume there could be other similar situations. Perhaps we should pay attention to the reasons why “best” among “bad” candidates were rejected. I think we mark candidates with the failure kind during overload resolution. #Closed"

"> I'm a bit worried about modifying the environment from a test. Smells like a concurrency issue waiting to happen. Is that something we do elsewhere?

In general this is true. For example if we even see environment variables being manipulated from within individual unit tests then that is highly suspicious. In this case though we are manipulating an the module initializer level so that effectively means it's setting it at the process level. 

The one part I'm worried about though is there is the potential for a subtle timing issue. Essentially imagine if DiaSym gets loaded before the module initializer runs. Then it will potentially load from the wrong place and there is no protection or detection for that.

"Wrong direction. @github "
"@github , I dug into it a lot deeper last night, asp.net is obviously doing the right thing.  F# obviously has a bug.

The net5.0 is a red-herring.

The F# Compiler has always done a thing that is pretty icky, that Roslyn doesn't really do.  It was originally done for usability reasons to make the command line compile easy for developers to manage when typing ````fsc program.fs```` and also to make ````fsi.exe```` not require a bunch of ````#r ""references""```` for framework assemblies.

When we originally did the coreclr port of fsc this behavior was omitted, but over time, much of it has crept back in.

The F# compiler tries to acquire the framework assemblies at the start in order to do that it has a bunch of horrible probing code.  The xcopied coreclr + global.json scenario is just not consistently and well followed by fsc.exe and fsi.exe

What is going wrong in the case shown above is actually two bugs.

1. We appear to be finding the wrong ````dotnet.exe```` we are executing the global one from program files instead of the xcopied version.
2. Even if we got that correct (which we don't) a later step which then tries to get the contents of the pack directory would only examine packs from the global dotnet location rather than merging them with the xcopied packs folder in order to find the correct set of framework reference assemblies as specified by the global.json

So in short ... F# is buggy in the presence of an xcopied netsdk and global.json file.

My goal is a stable UI, think of the following: `A` and `C` are in the UI and the user is just hovering over `C` to select it. At that time  `B` is getting resolved. It should not push down `C` because the user would then select `B` instead of `C`. The tricky bit is that we are talking about a tree. I not sure what to do when the tree contains `A/B` and `C/D`, the user is selecting `D` and at the same time another child is inserted into the `A`-subtree. It will push down the `C`-subtree, making the user click the wrong item.

Thanks for providing more feedback. Yes that seems to be happening, and I do agree we need to somehow hack it in that when the editor ""gets focus"" such that not too much is read out. We can aslo ask on NVDA github page for ideas how to potentially achieve this.
Also if we move paramter hints to also use activeDescendetes we will have the same issue, once the paremeterHints get closed the editor aria label we get re-read.

A crazy idea which I have and I am not sure if it will work is that we set ariaHidden=true on the editor instead of cleaning out its ariaLabel. The focus goes back to the editor, nothing gets read out and after a timeout we remove this ariaHidden attribute. That would sort of make the editor invisible to the screen reader for a very brief perioud of time.

For other fixes: no problem, no need for appologies :)

"Yes, it will keep all the Sum overloads. It is possible to fully specify the exact method, but it really complicates the signature. And in my opinion, makes this a lot more risky. We do get linker warnings if the method can't be resolved. But if we get the wrong one, we could have a bug.

For example:

```C#
[DynamicDependency(""Where`1"", typeof(Enumerable))]
```

would now become:

```C#
[DynamicDependency(""Where`1(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{``0},System.Func{``0,System.Boolean})"", typeof(Enumerable))]

Do you think I should go ahead and change all of them to specify the exact signature?"

"I don't think this is the right place to be doing this. You're deferring the viewport size, but that's not the same thing as the buffer size. I don't know if this is good enough to make the Terminal alt buffer work (I haven't looked at that side), but in cohost the results are a bit bonkers. For example, try something like this:

```
printf ""\e[?1049h"" # Switch to alt buffer
printf ""\e[8;24;60t"" # Make the window narrower (assuming 80x24 shrinking to 60x24)
printf ""\e[?1049l"" # Switch back to the main buffer
```

I'd expect the main buffer to keep that 60x24 size, but what you get is a 80 width buffer in a 60 width window. In other cases it'll just do nothing at all.

And ideally this would be using the same mechanism as the existing `_fAltWindowChanged` deferred sizing, otherwise there are bound to be weird results when you mix the too. I don't know how feasible that is though.

I honestly don't know what the right answer is here, but this definitely feels wrong."
"> Do you want the output of the tool to explain how typemaps work and what they are? 

No, not the *output of the tool*;  The `README.md` of the tool.  Which is why this comment thread started on the `README.md`.

And again, I'd be happy to write up that description, I just wasn't sure what some of the values were supposed to mean.

For example, my initial Hello World build did no linking, and thus was *huge* (yay?), with 6062 Java-to-managed entries and 5376 Managed-to-Java entries.

This should be ~everything in `Mono.Android.dll`, right? (Perhaps not?  There are 10848 TypeDefinitions within `Mono.Android.dll`, though not every typedef is a distinct binding, so ""half-ish"" might be a sensible value.)

So why don't any of these entries appear to produce output in the `Is-Generic-Type?` column?  Or am I missing something?  I thought we needed the `generic` column for e.g. `Android.Runtime.JavaList<T>`?

…which oddly isn't present?!

```
% grep JavaList x/typemap-v1-Debug-X86_64-managed.txt
Android.Runtime.JavaList, Mono.Android	java/util/ArrayList		duplicate entry
```

There *is* a generic type present, but it doesn't have anything in the `Is-Generic-Type?` column:

```
% grep JavaArray x/typemap-v1-Debug-X86_64-managed.txt
Android.Runtime.JavaArray`1, Mono.Android	mono/android/runtime/JavaArray		
```

Why doesn't `JavaArray<T>` have a value for `Is-Generic-Type`?

For that matter, why is `JavaArray<T>` the only generic type in here?

```
% grep '`' x/typemap-v1-Debug-X86_64-managed.txt
Android.Runtime.JavaArray`1, Mono.Android	mono/android/runtime/JavaArray		
```

"From the perspective of the analyzer ALC there are essentially two different questions that it needs to answer for a given assembly path that it's asked to load. 

1. Is this an assembly that should be handled by the default ALC? 
2. Is this an assembly that was specified via `/analyzer` and hence valid to *attempt* to load here? 

It is unclear based on the method name here which of the questions this is satisfying. Given that it is on the `AnalyzerAssemblyLoader` type though likely this handles case (1) above. 

If so though then specifying a file path is likely the wrong parameter type. Instead I would expect `AssemblyName` as the parameter, or even just a `string` representing the simple name. That is all the information required to answer (1) above. 

Essentially I was expecting something along the lines of: 

```c#
/// <summary>

/// to load. 
/// </summary>

Now there's nothing wrong about putting performance first, it made a lot of sense for the original scenarios that netcore targeted. This is also true for mono. There's a lot of code, even in the Xamarin years, where performance alone (without size) was considered.

Expending the scenarios to include mobile means that code examples (like your linke) will become more common (at build time or thru the linker).

Ideally new code will consider both perf/size and not assume existing code did the same :)"
">_lazyBackingFieldSymbolForFieldKeyword [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=63&length=38)

This feels like a move to the wrong direction. It looks like now we can end up with two backing field symbols at the same time. One is created for the initializer, another is created for the ```field``` keyword. Not only we increase the amount of information we store for a property symbol, we also create confusion with two distinct field symbols to work with and choose between. 
I assume that this change was made to be able to distinguish tree states:
1. We haven't created a backing field and we don't know if we need it. 
2. We haven't created a backing field, but we know that we don't need it. 
3. We created a backing field.

As I indicated in one of the earlier threads, we can distinguish all tree states with just one field by using a sentinel value that indicates the ""unknown"" state (null value become a ""known"" state when the field is not needed). Here is the quote: ""Usually, we don't use any additional flags in order to be able to track three states like that. Instead, we use sentinel values to represent uninitialized/unknown state. See ```SourceMemberMethodSymbol._lazyIteratorElementType```, for example.""

Given that it is hard to create a dummy value of ```SynthesizedBackingFieldSymbol```. I suggest doing the following:
- Add ```static private readonly _sentinel = new object();```
- Change ```_lazyBackingFieldSymbol``` as follows ```private object _lazyBackingFieldSymbol = _sentinel;```.
- The field value should be updated only if its value is equal to ```_sentinel``` value. ```InterlockedCompareExchange``` can help with that.
- A simple check against ```_sentinel``` value (instead of a null value) can be used to test if we are still in an unknown state and have some work to do.
- We might need to record an extra information about whether the symbol was created by constructor. That can be recorder in the ```SynthesizedBackingFieldSymbol``` the same way we record whether it was created for a ```field``` keyword.

"This is going to be a problem if the split did not return with 2 items in it. To avoid  surprises, test the length, if it is not the correct, exit 1 stating the reason. Otherwise we might get a $null. Pwsh does not throw exceptions when you index wrongly an array, for example:
```pwsh
$foo = @(""one"", ""two"")
$result = $foo[3]
if ($null -eq $result) {
    Write-Host ""You've got a null value!""
}
```
Because you are getting null, you get the wrong path. "
">nameof [](http://example.com/codeflow?start=95&length=6)

The presence of `nameof` here makes no difference because we are not speculating on the resulting ```InvocationExpressionSyntax```. This confuses the reader and because of that potentially sets wrong expectations."
"Unfortunately the packaging fails [which I anticipated] by having the symlinks point to wrong location:
```
filipnavara@172-4-1-17 app % ls -l /Library/Frameworks/Xamarin.Mac.framework/Versions/Current/lib/mono/Xamarin.Mac/RedistList/

```

I suppose I need to modify it to make the symlink with absolute path.

Is there any way to make the packages locally? Or can you give me pointer on how the other symlinks are handled? I also have an alternative solution without symlinks but I would like to understand the process nevertheless."
"Should we enforce in the runtime that the field passed to `CreateSpan` is always of a locally defined type and the packing matches the alignment (unless ref emitted, I guess)?

That way we won't have IL Linker/crossgen2 breaking code that works in the absence of those tools. There's still a slight chance that the alignment in metadata is wrong, but it eliminates some of the risk. E.g. Roslyn sometimes avoids introducing the PrivateImplementationDetails type if it can use a primitive type and who knows if that codepath could kick in."
"Ah, the beauty of ""Why didn't we have tests for this?"". ""We do, they just expected the wrong behavior"" :-)"
"I'm still getting used to the way we use intersection types in TS, so pardon me if this is a dumb question: why return the extra property using an intersection type and then pass it on as a separate parameter?  Also, why not actually add it to the type?  To avoid modifying the exported interface?"
Can we add some assert here that we never get non-generic IEnumerable interface. Just to protect against any wrong future use of this method.
"Right, things have already gone very wrong if think we have a tailcall with a retbuf that can be optimized with this optimization.
I will just revert this change, we will hit the assert inside of `gtCallGetDefinedRetBufLclAddr` if the flag is set and we don't have a retbuf."
"Correct me if I am wrong but a bad guessing is not really a problem - it just most likely will cause the first ""reserve"" probe to fail - we'll append 4mb to the address for the next probe 🤷‍♂️"
"Are you sure? It could be that rather than choosing a method with the wrong
signature to add to the event that the wrong event had been chosen.

"We want existing ruleset files to work cross platform - so that users can open existing projects in Xamarin Studio on Mac, for example. So we need to handle both separators.

How about we first check if the file exists as specified. If it doesn't let's make the `\` to `/` replacement in the original string (before we expand env vars) and repeat the process. This won't handle crazy corner cases like mixed separators in Linux-mounted Windows partitions, but I think that's fine.

BTW, I noticed we call `ExpandEnvironmentVariables`. I bet Linux implementation of this method doesn't handle %VAR% syntax, or does it? I guess with some luck not many customers actually use this feature and leave it Windows specific for now. Perhaps file an issue to track this as a potential cross platform problem.

It really feels like a leaking abstraction. If my whole project is defined in TypeScript, why am I needing to reference JS files, that's basically a runtime concern in my opinon.

I also _quite_ dislike the need to specify a file extension in the first place. It is a DX regression from where we are today IMHO, and is not common in other programming languages.

In summary I would hope the TS compile can convert non-suffixed imports into `*.js` suffixed imports as part of the transpile step and keep the DX experience a lot cleaner.

> [EnableBlockingMitigation]

From a ""make sure we don't negatively affect unexpected things"" perspective, I'd be happier with that, assuming it wouldn't require anything in the runtime to do reflection on everything to look for things that might have such an attribute.  It of course still requires someone to know there's a problem, what the problem is, and what solutions there are for addressing it: at that point, we're limiting ourselves to the subset of problems where the developer is prevented from actually doing the ""right thing"" (e.g. they're forced to implement a sync interface and have only async tools at their disposal to do so) rather than the subset where they don't realize they're doing the ""wrong thing"".  From a complexity and impact perspective, while I do understand the appeal of a detect-bad-actors-and-throttle-them approach, I still think we should first be looking at and testing out simpler approaches, like tweaks to thread injection strategy we've talked about previously (e.g. ramp up beyond ProcessorCount faster than we do today)."

The goal of this PR is to enable [pipeline-caching](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/caching?view=azure-devops) for build scenarios of coreclr and libraries. In future, we would like to extend it for scenarios like building test, Mono and to some extent test execution. 

## Overview

The idea behind pipeline caching is simple. After the artifacts of a particular job is produced, store it in an Azure cache against a particular ""cache key"". If there is a subsequent run that happens in the pipeline (related or unrelated to the original run), and if the ""cache key"" matches, the job will simply download the cached contents and skip producing the artifacts entirely, saving us some machine time. In this PR, the artifacts creation that I am optimizing is the creation of coreclr and libraries binaries. During the coreclr/libraries build step, it will see if we have already built the binaries and if yes, it will simply download it from Azure storage and upload it as pipeline artifacts. All the steps related to installing pre-requisite tools, product build, zipping, etc. will be skipped. This is possible using `Cache@2` task of AzDo.

## Scenarios

In this PR, the support of pipeline-caching is added to all the pipelines (internal and public) that consumes `coreclr/templates/build-job.yml` and `libraries/build-job.yml` files and if triggered `Manually` or through a `PullRequest`. To take an example, if a developer submits a PullRequest that just touches `libraries` folder. During the first execution of `runtime` pipeline on the PR branch, the `build-job.yml` would build required coreclr/libraries builds. If the developer further pushes more changes and if between the initial and subsequent changes, if there were no additional changes done in `coreclr` folder on `main` branch (see more details below), the caching will restore the previously cached CoreCLR binaries without needing to build them again. It will also upload the required artifacts, just as it happens today. Since there are at least 10~30 different configuration of `coreclr` builds we do, if the cache is ""hit"", we could save approximately 30 * 15 mins = 450 minutes of machine execution time on the subsequent run once this feature is enabled. As of today, the cache key is only matched per PR-branch. In other words, if there is a PR# AAA that touched `libraries` folder and we built and cached the artifacts that were produced out of it. Next there is another PR# BBB that is sent out and it too just touched `libraries` folder, and between `AAA` and `BBB` there were no `coreclr` commits in `main`, PR #BBB will still not be able to use cached contents. I have opened an https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/15589 to check why. The documentation clearly says that such scenarios are allowed, and cache can be used across branches within the same pipeline. However, if there were further updates to PR `AAA`, the cached contents can be used.

To summarize, in the best case, for a single additional push to a PR branch, pipeline caching can save up to 450 minutes of machine time. The worst case, when there are too many frequent changes in `coreclr` and `libraries`, the cache-key will never match and we will end up building the product, the way we do today except that we will continue to cache them in the hope that some run will use it. The step that caches the contents takes approximately 20 seconds and hence should not regress the current workflow.

## Cache Key

`Cache@2` needs a cache-key that should be unique for that particular run. Azdo creates a fingerprint of the cache-key and uses it to search for the cached contents. One portion of the cache-key should contain the build specific information like OS name, Architecture, BuildType (Debug, Checked or Release), framework name, etc. However, we also need a unique identifier to confirm if there were any changes in folders/files that would help us decide if a build is needed or not. The way I approached it is by checking the git-hashes of the paths we are interested in. [get_commit_hash](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62464/files#diff-e60af28e3f16bb69b02b4c0017f9bd4b7abfdd0a50416e1848858d4a59c886faR41) is the python script that I would trigger to fetch the git-hashes of the paths that are interested for that particular build. For examples, if building `coreclr`, I would check the git commit hashes of `src/coreclr` and `src/native` folder. All the git commit hashes along with the build configuration (OS, architecture, etc.) is saved in a commit.txt file. I then use the contents of this file as the cache key that AzDo will use to check if it is a ""cache hit"" or a ""cache miss"".

Before we run the pipeline, we always merge the latest `main` in the PR branch. In such cases, if files inside `coreclr` is touched, we will always find a unique *merge* hash commit for `coreclr` folder and hence mismatch the previous cache key. This will guarantee that we build `coreclr` if there are any changes in that folder. On the contrary, we just fetch 40 commit's history during checkout. I added code to fetch little more history so we can correctly see the last commit that changed a folder/file. But sometimes, that might not be enough, and the files/folders might have changed prior to the history we have on AzDo machine. In such case, I will make an entry of `grafted` next to the file path. [Here](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=1503794&view=logs&j=54cabf5c-1ba4-54c9-31cb-a3ef0d378039&t=43aed140-0b0f-5596-36b8-b27458d6e610) are sample logs from [get_commit_hash file](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62464/files#diff-e60af28e3f16bb69b02b4c0017f9bd4b7abfdd0a50416e1848858d4a59c886fa).

## Design

As mentioned previously, the `UsePipeline` variable is set to true only if the run is triggered from a PullRequest or Manually. It will be used to determine if `Cache@2` needs to be executed. There are other variables like `BUILD_CACHE_RESTORED`, BUILD_LOGS_RESTORED`, etc. that are set if the cache is restored. The values of these variables are then used to determine whether we should perform a particular step or should skip it.

There are few templates where the checks for `BUILD_CACHE_RESTORED` was needed and there is not a reliable way to add this in condition. Hence, I had to add their check explicitly in those yml files.

## Lookouts

Reviewers, please make sure if the paths I have listed in [get_commit_hash](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/62464/files#diff-e60af28e3f16bb69b02b4c0017f9bd4b7abfdd0a50416e1848858d4a59c886faR41) are correct and if more paths need to be added in the given categories.

## Next

I have a kustos query to understand if we are hitting ""Cache Hit"" or not. So in future, if we think that we almost never hit cache, we can look back and see how to improve things. Overall, if this is successful, it will also prove beneficial to cache building coreclr/libraries test because they are changed less frequently and hence will certainly be restored from the cache.

## Risk

It could happen that due to a bug, we might restore the cache that contains wrong or incorrect build artifacts. To work around, a developer can always make changes to one of the paths listed under `common` category and in such cases, the cache will always guarantee to see a cache miss. I have also opened https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/15583 to track some other issues in this feature.

In https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/68085, I relaxed the heuristics under which we would use SIMD registers for copy block unroll code. The code generated uses temporary registers to addresses to copy (could be GC references) and they are not reported. As such, we should mark the unroll code region as GC non-interruptible to make sure GC doesn't kick in and collect the wrong objects.

Note: We were marking `gtBlkOpGcUnsafe` only for situation where destination address was local, but never checked about the source address. This PR expands it to situation when either src/dst addresses are non-local (on heap).

Technically we should fix the doc - maybe it is the wrong index as I see a `1`. Maybe we renamed a param and did not update the xml files?
"> Is that really a problem, though? The prerendering system never starts emitting any response until the initial async render is completed. So the only way that the response has started is if it's for an unrelated reason, so it's no different from someone trying to do a redirection in MVC after they've already started flushing out output - the rules for that are well understood. As such it doesn't look to me like this would be unreliable at all.

Yeah, but this needs to work well with MVC and I'm pretty sure we've discouraged people in the past from doing a redirect within a View. Even if you succeed in the redirect, a lot of things can go wrong in the server and it's just walking into unknown territory.

It's not simply about performing the redirect, but about what happens on the server. How do you stop rendering, do you throw? If so you start polluting your logs with exceptions that are surreptitiously used to do flow control.

IMO we need to think about this in detail, so for now I want to just throw until we tackle it in a holistic way."
"Because when you run tests and do things like shadow-copying (like in tests), the location points to the wrong place. This is what MVC does to find related assemblies as part of application parts, and it has been improved a couple of times based on user feedback."
"The scenario that caused it was that my tests new-up an Application object then operate on that, so when I for example do two adds it's operating on the same object, so it tries to Load the project twice.

"> I think we need to at least check on the RemoteRenderer before we call ProcessPendingRender during OnRenderCompleted

Great point. Yes. I'm adding a check for that.

> Should we log something here and no-op instead?

Since we have no reason to believe it's at possible to make this happen through normal coding patterns, I'd be more interested in having a way of getting alerted if we're wrong and it does somehow happen.

If we can articulate definite scenarios where we want to support this I'm totally open to changing this though!

> I think no-oping is safer as there might be legitimate scenarios where something got queued into the sync context and the context got disposed before it got a chance to execute (as things get serialized).

Do you have specific scenarios in mind? The scenarios I'm aware of when renders are started are:

 * If a component asks to be rendered - this already no-opped if the renderer (or component) was already disposed.
 * When adding a new root component. If the renderer was already disposed, I think it's good to throw, since it's so bizarre to be adding a new root component then. For normal server-side Blazor, the registered root component(s) will be added immediately during host creation, so definitely before disposal.
 * When resuming the queue processing after an ACK, which will now be no-opped by the updated logic here.

"@github I didn't realise there were any issues *building* the E2ETests project. That sounds serious and we would want to know if that goes wrong. I don't think we should be suppressing that kind of problem (e.g., maybe it reflects some actual SDK issue)."
"@github i highly suspect your'e right.  This is why i proposed the above:

> Note: a better approach might be to have this data just passed through the API instead of trying to re-establish it at this point in the code. It might make it clearer at which point the info is getting 'out of sync' as it were...

It's pretty clear to me that this code is trying to synthesize a relation that doesn't seem to exist.  So, it would likely be better if the entire codepath was explicit about passing this data along, and then had explicit code to try to decide what to do if/when the data didn't meet its expectation.  i.e. if the buffer we have for ""newTreeTags"" doesn't match teh one for ""oldTreeTags"", we really need to have explicit code to understand what that means, and what to do about it.

Note: this is also pretty scary to me given that taggers are supposed to be either view or buffer associated.  If we're breaking that assumption... then we need to do some pretty substantial rethinking of things.  

As an alternative, we could try to figure out why we're getting a tagger that isn't really associated with a single buffer, and we could try to change things to make it so that we have that invariant.  i.e. instead of reusing this tagger across buffer, ensure we have a unique tagger per buffer.  That way we coudl then put in invariant-checks in the code that we weren't operating on the wrong buffer."

"@github I think there is a weird cycle now between `editorGroupView#layout` and `tabsTitleControl#layout`: 
* first we ask the tabs title control for the height using `offsetHeight` which can trigger a full browser layout btw
* then we ask to layout the tabs title control
* this potentially results in the title control to change its height depending on the logic inside
* but we still use the previous computed height for the editor
* we may end up using the wrong height for the editor

I think conceptually it should be:
* `editorGroupView#layout` which will trigger...
* ...title control layout which returns its height that it ended up using
* then editor control layout with that height

With this algorithm I would also think that you do not need to know the editor height, you can simply pass the overall height into the title control layout and then decide from within if the title should wrap or not.

Does that make sense?

As for the additional challenge that a `redraw` of tabs can result in the title height changing: I think this should not trigger a `relayout`, rather I would think that the tabs title control should have an event that is fired whenever the height changes and the editor group can register on that to trigger `redraw`. I think that would also help for the current logic that triggers `redraw` when breadcrumbs are enabled or disabled.

**PS:** I think it would be good if the CSS changes in tabsTitleControl.css could get some comments, I am having a hard time understanding the need for the properties, as well as the `important` and it would help for future maintenance if the logic is explained via comments."

"...now that we're digging into this, an obvious question is this: *Why does anybody care?*

Additionally, the description is wrong.

(Also, let's stop using ""Android Callable Wrapper"" and stick with ""Java Callable Wrapper"". ;-)

Consider a variation on the previous [repro instructions](
https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/2258/files#r222784089): two assemblies which both declare the ""same"" C# type:

```csharp
namespace Lib1
{
  public class EmptyClass : Java.Lang.Object
  {
  }
}
```

We thus have two different `Lib1.EmptyClass` types running around.  However, because there is no `[Register]`, then we hit the default ""md5-ify everything"" approach, which means we *can* emit two separate Java Callable Wrapper types: `md56bf89f81d87b2a3b578f763649ead9ef.EmptyClass` for `Lib1.EmptyClass, Lib1` and `md551eaf02b2ef90dc8aacda5445b93be5c.EmptyClass` for `Lib1.EmptyClass, Lib2`.

We *can* -- *do* -- generate Java Callable Wrappers for *both* types.

Thus, why care that we have two separate ""Lib1.EmptyClass"" types running around?  What's the *actual* problem?

The actual problem comes in places where an assembly cannot be specified, such as within `.axml` files.  There, if we used `<Lib1.EmptyClass/>`, there is no way to say ""use the `EmptyClass` type from Lib1"" vs. ""use the `EmptyClass` type from Lib2"".  It's ambiguous.

However, *fragments* allow avoiding this, e.g. by using `<fragment type=""Lib1.EmptyClass, Lib1"" />`.  (No idea if anyone actually uses that functionality, but it exists.)  Again, though, if you use `<fragment type=""Lib1.EmptyClass"" />` -- no assembly -- then *one* of the types is picked.  The first one.

What is the fix?  Change the type names so that they have different C# Namespace.Type names.  The documentation should likewise mention how to fix the warning."

I actually think your code comments are good, they’re just hard to find because they’re two whole files away from the formatter. You wouldn’t really know in `formatting.ts` or `formattingScanner.ts` that you were going to create “synthesized” tokens, so to speak, unless you actually went into the scanner itself.

What we did know is that there are scenarios where the old scheme caused unnecessary heap growth, because we deleteted the free lists in gen 2 at the start of a background sweep, and so a gen 1 GC occurring at the wrong time may find fail to find a free space to compact items into. 

The new scheme updates free lists incrementally, so should not suffer from this problem.

"How is splitting the code into partial classes and conditionally compile them different from the ifdefs? I thought that:

means that we can guard the HTTP/3 stuff in place without splitting the code. Or am I wrong?

The issue is that `mono_type_is_reference` does not look at whether a generic parameter has a constraint that would make it a reference type (there is a big comment near `mono_type_is_reference` that making it do so would break generic
sharing).

The issue is if you have something like:

```

class BaseClass {}

public class C {
       public virtual BaseClass SomeCovariantFunction() => ...
}

public class G<T> : C where T : BaseClass {
       public override T SomeCovariantFunction() => ...
}
```

Here when setting up `G<T>` we do a check that the override of `SomeCovariantFunction` that returns T is a valid, which boils down to checking that `T` is ok for a covariant return from `BaseClass`.  This is mostly the same as `BaseClass` is-assignable-from `T`, except we also need to check that `T` is not a valuetype that implements interface `BaseClass`.  That check was wrong.  The fix is to check for `is_valuetype`, not `!is_reference` on `T`.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/58326

Backport of #58392 to release/6.0

/cc @github

## Customer Impact

Without this fix, users of `TimeZoneInfo.HasIanaId` can get wrong values when using `TimeZoneInfo.Local`.

We have exposed the new property `TimeZoneInfo.HasIanaId` in .NET 6.0. This property tells if the Time Zone object is created with IANA Id. This property returns the correct results except when using `TimeZoneInfo.Local`. The reason is when we initialize `TimeZoneInfo.Local` property we clone the object before returning it, but we missed cloning `HasIanaId` property inside the returned object. The fix is to ensure `HasIanaId` is initialized correctly in `TimeZoneInfo.Local`.

## Testing

I tested this on Windows and Linux. Also, I have run the whole regression tests with the fix without any problem. I added more tests to cover the test gap for the functionality we are fixing here.

## Risk

Is low. The fix is scoped to the `HasIanaId` property only which is a newly exposed property in .NET 6.0. The change is well tested and added more tests too.

"I feel this is the wrong place to do validation. The setter on the property should throw for invalid values:

"Talked offline. We might do this in a subsequent PR, but the kind of stuff I was trying initially where `Mvc.ModelBinding.IBindingSourceMetadata` implements `Http.Metadata.IBindingSourceMetadata` was pretty ugly.

```c#
namespace Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ModelBinding
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Metadata which specifies the data source for model binding.
    /// </summary>
    public interface IBindingSourceMetadata : Http.Metadata.IBindingSourceMetadata
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets the <see cref=""BindingSource""/>. 
        /// </summary>
        /// <remarks>
        /// The <see cref=""BindingSource""/> is metadata which can be used to determine which data
        /// sources are valid for model binding of a property or parameter.
        /// </remarks>
        new BindingSource? BindingSource { get; }

        Http.Metadata.BindingSource Http.Metadata.IBindingSourceMetadata.BindingSource
        {
            get => BindingSource?.Id switch
            {
                nameof(BindingSource.Path) => Http.Metadata.BindingSource.Route,
                nameof(BindingSource.Query) => Http.Metadata.BindingSource.Query,
                nameof(BindingSource.Header) => Http.Metadata.BindingSource.Header,
                nameof(BindingSource.Body) => Http.Metadata.BindingSource.Body,
                nameof(BindingSource.Form) => Http.Metadata.BindingSource.Form,
                nameof(BindingSource.Services) => Http.Metadata.BindingSource.Services,
                _ => Http.Metadata.BindingSource.Custom
            };
        }
    }
}
```

Now this doesn't even compile (C# doesn't like interfaces having members with the same name even if explicitly implemented), but you can see the ugliness of having two very similar interfaces.

There are 6 `IFrom*Metadata` attributes so far. I don't think that's too crazy. I do like that the eventual extensibility would be just to create a new interface rather than a second-class `Custom` or `Other` BindingSource."

That isn't the case for Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server but it also doesn't really matter. A 7.0.x dependency won't work in a 3.1.x or 6.0.x web application either.

One general point is Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server has no dependencies at all.

"I've had an idea for a different shape for this API which would make some things simpler, which would look something like this:

```ts
interface NotebookKernel {
    executeCells(document: NotebookDocument, cells: NotebookCellRange[], executionObject: NotebookCellExecution): Promise<SomeResult>;
}

// Kernel can call executeCommand('executeCell', { cell }); to trigger an execution
```

Peng and I discussed this. It's more in a direction similar to what we have today but keeps the execution object concept. Essentially the execution object would only be created by vscode and passed via the executeCells API, and if a kernel needs to trigger an execution, it would call some API or use executeCommand to do that, and vscode would call `executeCells` shortly after.

Pros are that it would give more of a ""single direction"" of data flow between vscode and the kernel. The run button clicking case and the kernel-initiated execution case would work exactly the same way. The executeCells API really feels like it should return a promise that actually follows the lifetime of the execution process, and this enables that.

Cons are that this inverses the relationship between vscode and the kernel. If the kernel really is the source of truth about whether a cell is executing, then it's wrong to have an API model where the kernel has to request that vscode start executing a cell. Really it has to be vscode that requests that the kernel start an execution, and the kernel telling vscode that it is executing. Tbh I'm having trouble telling whether this is just a philosophical problem or a real one. But I think that this solution has to lead to vscode being the one to maintain the execution state of a cell, rather than the kernel.

Also the shape above is not correct, we would need to figure out how to pass N execution objects for cells in the range, which is weird, or change the API to execute a single cell, which is also weird."

"Note that what I said above is a strict correctness requirement on morphing functions: they must not delete nodes under CSE (technically they must not delete active CSE candidates, but for simplicity and robustness it is preferred to simply not run folding under CSE), they must preserve VNs, not doing so can (and has) lead to hard to diagnose silent bad codegen bugs and/or crashes. Note that I think it will be hard to reproduce something going wrong here (perhaps with aggressive CSE for constants...), I would not recommend spending much time on finding a reproduction.

There is a possible exception to the ""must preserve VNs"" rule in that it should be ""fine"" to create new nodes with `NoVN`, but we shy away from doing so for simplicity purposes (it is easier to reason about - ""Does morph preserve VNs?"" -- ""Yes, always"", instead of ""Well, sort of kind of"")."

"But do we need two ways to do it? I'm just arguing for `null` because it's consistent with `tsconfig` files.

"> Seems like we have an issue in TieredCompilation in the call count logic. Since we are doing a reverse P/Invoke it is possible the thread doesn't exist.

Is this an issue that would exist before this change or only after this change?

My first thought is that the reverse-pinvoke transition would be the best place to create the thread object. Would that be possible? I'm not aware if that is something that is being tried to be avoided.

If this is expected after this change, I'm curious about other potential issues with the thread object not existing.

> I think that (2) is probably the right thing to do since the call is going to have to create a thread anyways.

Where would the thread object be created?

If it's reaching this path without a thread object available, it can also reach jitted code of the method without the thread object being available. I'm not sure if there would be other issues with that. Just an example, how would the following not be possible:
- The native-callable method is already jitted (on a different thread)
- The native code calls the method from the new thread after it has already been jitted, which would typically go to the jitted code without going through the prestub
- The managed native-callable method calls a virtual method that ends up in `VSD_ResolveWorker`, which may have similar issues with not having the thread object available - not entirely sure

I don't know if it is currently safe to call managed code on a thread without a thread object, perhaps others would know. From briefly looking at the relevant code, it almost seems like a thread object is necessary to transition between preemptive and cooperative GC modes, though that's just a far estimation and I could be wrong about that."

However, the logic only skips for _certain_ instantiations involving marker types, namely those where one type argument is a marker type and the remaining type arguments are just the type parameters themselves. That means we _don't_ skip over variance checking for a type instantiation like `Child<?, unknown>` (where `?` is a marker type), and that's the kind of instantiation we get in the example because of the defaulted type argument for `B`. So, we start reporting `Ternary.Unknown` results where really we should be doing structural comparisons.

Changing our logic to skip variance checking for any type instantiation where at least one type argument is a marker type fixes the issue. It causes us to do a bit more structural comparing when computing variances, but obviously it was wrong not to do this extra work. I think this is the solution we want to go with. I will put up a new PR and we'll see what the performance impact is, if any."
"> Hmm, I think I need to rebase for that one, don't I?

I could be wrong but I expect that runs that are triggered via `/azp run` are merged with the current main head, just like the default runtime-dev-innerloop.

"> If we rely on polling to be set doesn't that mean we have a problem with the product, since that is not the default?

Hi @github - yes, but I think this is a somewhat known issue for certain environments. In fact, I just had to update docs to mention details about this per @github, see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/51866#issuecomment-826936347. 

I'm not certain that this is isolated to Ubuntu 16.04, but that is the only environment that I saw occasionally failing for this test unit test. I believed it to be related to the `FileSystemWatcher` not reliably signaling that the file has changed. I also found an old [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31236514/2410379) that mentioned concerns with Ubuntu and the `FileSystemWatcher` not signaling. I could be wrong, but I did want to at least give it a try."

"The seem to be test failures there, for example:
```

```

But the test upload probably didn't work, or something else happened since the specific test results are not available. There are also no detailed logs from the tests (the `xml` files or similar).

I don't know enough about the infra to be able to tell if this is a problem, or by design. In any case we will either need to get a repro, or at least get the test logs for the failures in CI to have a clue what's going on.

One idea: @github when you tried to repro it - does your machine have the latest RC2 bits installed globally? Specifically - do you have anything in `/usr/local/share/dotnet/x64` ? It should not be there if this is running on x64 hardware...
I can't tell from the logs what is the hardware this runs on - if it's an arm64 hardware... I could see several different things potentially going wrong."

I used the wrong register in the VM stub implementation for this function.
In addition, some changes are necessary for VSD calls through dispatcher
(that we cannot do on x64).

Fix #65111

Also remove macOS from the jit-cfg job. jit-cfg includes a GCStress
scenario which is not supported on macOS x64. Rather than
excluding it just there, just exclude all of macOS since CFG is a
Windows only feature anyway.

I am still keeping the Linux-x64/Linux-arm64 jobs as we produce
different IR for arguments on these ABIs and I want to keep the CFG
handling working in general for all the forms of IR we can produce
related to calls.

"Now that we had the logging to see what was wrong, I was able to reproduce the real problem in a test and fix it:

https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-android/pull/6043"
"I don't understand, we were in the same meeting where we decided that's not a good idea without giving a consumer of IBufferWriter a way to notify other components that memory is preserved.


Even with pipe implementation holding onto Memory is safe only until flush is called which is often not controlled by IBufferWriter consumer. Like in the following sample:

``` C#
var writer = new SomeLenghtPrefixSerializer(response.BodyPipe);
foreach (var o in objects)
{
   writer.WriteObject(o);
   // Is this safe to do or is writer still holding onto memory?
   await response.BodyPipe.FlushAsync();
}
```

Getting this kind of assumption wrong can lead to severe consequences - considering that we reuse blocks response intended for one client can be sent to another one.

Another reason is that IBufferWriter implementation can be transforming bytes synchronously (encryption/compression) after they were advanced. "
"The default is being calculated incorrectly in the use case where I'm deriving from `WAF<T>` to host an HTTP server on a real port for Selenium UI tests, so there's no point reaching in for it, because it's wrong. This mean that the application was failing to find various static assets, like JS files, so the tests were failing.

I needed to manually ""fix"" it, and that involved having to duplicate this code so I could re-use it:

https://github.com/martincostello/alexa-london-travel-site/blob/e9af0ce3e70c7cbb0d047a276db42491ccec89e5/tests/LondonTravel.Site.Tests/Integration/TestServerFixture.cs#L83

It's possible that there's a separate issue either here or in my code that means the root is being set/calculated/overridden incorrectly in the first place, but it seemed ""better"" to be able to just leverage the code that was already there (but privately), rather than having to copy-paste as I've had to do with 2.2 and 3.0 preview 2."

"I completely agree. Fast engagement can save a lot investigation later by helping bug reporters provide more details, a better repro, etc...

> Investigations, which accumulate no more than 5 upvotes and/or comments by different users during a period of a month will be automatically closed. The reason is that the impact is very scoped and potentially something is wrong in the user code.

I understand the desire to auto-close issues to reduce our workload, but I think this would allow too many things to fall under the radar. I support @github's suggestion of using the ""Needs: Author feedback"" as the primary mechanism for auto-closing investigations.

If it really is something wrong in the user code or environment, we can usually figure that out by asking for a simplified repro (and not getting one). Oftentimes, bug submitters will report back with what they did wrong which allows us to learn common pitfalls and gives us opportunity to try to improve docs or APIs. Often times bug submitters will go ahead and submit a PR to improve the docs themselves."
"I would be careful with those things, since I'm not sure how it affects timer registration and other lower level things. I'm not saying that what you are suggesting is wrong, just that I can't confidently say is right."
"We do not have a dedicated IOperation for default label, but do have a different case kind: http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/Operations/CaseKind.cs,65f316f2e0138ff5,references.

What if the user puts in the wrong int? Wouldn't that throw a casting exception?

">ExplicitBaseImplementationNotConsideredImplementationForInterfaceWithDifferentTupleNames_02 [](start = 20, length = 91)

Looks like a new error (compat issue). It would be good to dig up the latest LDM notes on the topic. If I recall, the previous behavior was intentional (tuple names don't matter in OHI).

For what it's worth, the notes in speclet: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/tuples.md#overloading-overriding-hiding

What's wrong here? #Resolved
"That's certainly what I wrote.

Really it's that

* All the parameters types show the fields as nullable, because they're also input types.
* When exported, the public fields aren't null
* This helper therefore never sees null
* But it takes many `!`s to express that.

If extended to the full ""compare this parameters struct to that one"", null and empty are different (though empty is ""wrong""), so I went with this behavior."
"dumb question.  why is this here, instead of inside `._protocol.GoToDefinitionAsync` when it needs to call out to 3rd parties?"
"> I'd say taking dependency on that behavior was wrong

Valuing back-compat means I won't second-guess whether dependencies on our current behavior are wise, reasonable, or intentional. I only care how likely it is that the dependencies exist and weigh the harm it would cause customers to have their working app break vs. the value the change brings.

> Let's make it consistent and predictable

These aren't the attributes I value much when modifying existing shipping code. If there are specific scenarios that customers are likely to hit and making this change will benefit them then that could be compelling. Otherwise I am quite content sticking with the devil I know : )"
"I would consider it wrong. Having both encodings be non-null means we've produced an `EmitOptions` that can't really be represented on the command line. Further it complicates the logic to know ""was a fallback enocding used?"" When looking at a `Compilation` you can just do a `null` check but when looking at `EmitOptions` the same `null` check for the same named property is not sufficient. "
The previous logic was wrong here too but EnableDebugging is more like DebugLevel and is and integer.  The integer value should be passed to the call.
"Test is wrong now. I originally was throwing from everyhting that was in-memory before I figured out we actually doc'd the behavior. I need to write a new test using single-file, but don't know where to write the test"
"@github thanks for finding that, I can confirm it looks suspicious. I have opened https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/108607 to look into it. This will also require that `preload` scripts get access to the configuration, or a subset. Once I have tackled that problem, we should revisit this PR too.

> Just reiterating so we are on the same page, the problem that this tries to fix is that VS Code is trying to check the wrong environment for VSCODE_CLI and VSCODE_FORCE_USER_ENV. 

Understood. One impact your change has is that we will now always resolve the shell environment on startup, even if you start from the command line. This may have a bad impact on startup perf because we need to spawn another process. A more elegant solution imho would be to really only trigger this dance for the first window that needs it. But I cannot really see a good solution for this at the moment given we resolve the shell environment once and then store the promise.

"This path is wrong "
"I'm _mildly_ worried about putting the emoji in the file as literals like this - I know in the past we've had issues where someone's text editor saves a file with emoji as the wrong encoding which then end up breaking the tests later. I could be mistaken though, I'll let @github or @github refresh my memory if this is a bad idea or not."
"Instead of defining `_errorFormat` as a global constant it's probably easier to understand if you write:
```cpp
static std::wstring formatResultCode(HRESULT hr)
{
    return fmt::format(L""{0} ({0:#010x})"", hr);
}
```

But is there any specific reason you didn't just put this format specifier into the .resw strings (not saying this is wrong - just curious)?"
"As per: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/sys/types.h.html

`stat::st_size` is of type `off_t`, and `off_t` is a *signed* integral type.

Admittedly, it would be bona-fide *crazy* for `sbuf.st_size` to be a negative value, so I suppose we don't need to check for negative sizes...do we?  (I hope not!)"
"~~Not easily. It would require a significant refactoring of construction.~~ I misread this as returning an actual thing, not `null`. It would be possible, but whether it's the right thing to do, I'd need to think on a bit. It certainly seems like `SignatureOnlyParameterSymbol` was not intended to be publicly exposed, as `ContainingSymbol` throws, so the fact that we have them at all feels wrong to me."
"> I think projects tend to reuse shorthands. And certainly w/in a commit or series.

Agreed, yeah probably.

> I'm also open to ideas for how to write rules for extra exclusions. e.g. Ignore strings shorter than x characters, or longer than y characters.

I would immediately gravitate toward regex, but some people hate that.

> One thing you should do is review the whitelist, in reviewing it just now, I realized that there were a couple of misspellings in it... which I'm addressing by fixing & removing.

OK. I'll go read it as fully as I can.

> One example is `defing` which could easily be written out as `defining` if one wanted to force the word (the context is `#define` / `#undef`).

I don't think I'd be that critical, personally. But someone else might care more than me.

> There's also the odd case of `TfEditses.cpp` -- that resulted in `Editses` being in the whitelist, but the thing is `EditSession` and it probably should be `TfEditSes.cpp`. -- Addressing that would be a distinct PR as it's a significant code change (renaming a file) and I'd definitely want pre-approval before considering it.

It could even change straight up into `TfEditSession.cpp`. That's fine with me.

> Note that you'll probably see things like `egistry` in the whitelist, since `\r` and `\t` are often used as escape characters, my code makes some assumptions at the expense of forcing people to whitelist some things which aren't actually misspelled in context. -- Windows unfortunately (for my code) tends to use `\` as a path delimiter which means that when my code looks at the string it's making the wrong guess and lopping off that `r` or `t`.

Eh, that's OK.

> Anyway, please feel free to try it for a bit. I'm definitely eager to improve the experience.

Yes, I think we'll refine it further after it's in.

❔ Was this changed as part of the wrong commit?
"I just saw this change... I think it's faulty. It's also going to be more-wrong in any application that is configured to use Solarized via the ANSI/terminal codes, as the [Solarized Dark background `base03` is canonically _brblack_, index 8](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/#the-values).

I'd suggest, if you want to go this way, to adopt the [cmd-colours variation of Solarized](https://github.com/shanselman/cmd-colors-solarized), which swaps _all_ the bright/non-bright attributes. Using it requires modifying colour mappings for 16-colour Solarized themes, but at least it's a consistent swap rather than individual replacement, and already a known quantity for people coming from Conhost-based Solarized setups.

(Side-note: I was confused because this commit appears in the list of [commits to master _since_ 1.2.2022.0 was tagged](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/compare/v1.2.2022.0...master), linked from [the release](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/releases/tag/v1.2.2022.0). Is the git tag incorrect compared to the release?)

The gain is that `$ESC[48;5;0m` is now the same as `$ESC[40m`, i.e. hiding #293. The loss is that `$ESC[48;5;0m` and `$ESC[48;5;8m` (and hence `$ESC[40m` and `$ESC[100m` are reversed which means your dark background has the wrong brightness relationship to your dark foreground.

Why were you testing with `#073642` (`base02`) on `#002b36` (`base03`) BTW? Those are both background colours in Solarized, so you should never actually see that combination. If this is the problem we're trying to solve, then indeed just punting Solarized from the codebase is probably the best option, since it always requires further configuration than just switching a colour palette.

The same reason. We visit the stack in execution order (bottom to top, as mentioned in comments) and I wanted to make sure to not hoist children past its parents, if parents have side-effects. Let me know if you can think of a better way to validate this.

Pooling has costs. Extra code to avoid allocation needs to be loaded and JIT'd and has costs (beyond complexity and maintenance costs).

"Thanks for the much detailed feedback! It was very helpful.
1. As you've mentioned, I've modified the code so the autocompletion are also given to the `unknown`, `object`, `{}`,  `Record<string, any>` , *an object having String index type*, `<T extends object>`, `<T extends {}>`.

2. > More practically, it’s going to be too expensive to check the assignability of every identifier in the completions list, so I think the choice is between offering all the completions, even wrong ones, or none.

IMHO, offering all the completions would be better even if some of are wrong. The difference between the contextual type case is that dot can't be followed in shorthand completion so there's no chance that ending up with different type. Even though, as you mentioned, since checking all the assignability of the list is expensive, just offering them all rather than nothing could give more good user experience, I think.

3. If those types are good to go, I think types with `Object` and `Object | { a: string}`(Union type including empty object type) could be also good to go. In addition, the code below has no error with using `foo` inside of the object literal so it seems reasonable to suggest auto completion.
```ts
declare const foo: number;
interface Empty {}
interface Typed { typed: number; }

declare function f10<T extends Object>(obj: T): void;
declare function f13<T extends (Empty | Object | Typed)>(obj: T): void;

f10({foo});
f13({foo});

4. While I'm implementing this, I needed to check if the object is empty object type(ex: `{}`) or not.

- `isTypeSubsetOf()`
- `isEmptyObjectType()`
- `globalObjectType` (`@github getGlobalObjectType()`)

"I haven't looked at the pr yet. However my general concern is around how a particular piece of coffee knows which overload to use, and if there are problems if they use the wrong one. 

For example:

What if you're not in the codestyle layer?  Can you still use these? Should you?  Would it be bug if you used the wrong one?"
"> please note the signatures of AtomicComposition.TryGetValue<T>() were updated to [NotNullWhen(true)] out T? value rather than [MaybeNullWhen(false)] out T value

But that's not a valid change, is it?  null values are valid, and the caller could specify a nullable T, in which case the annotation is wrong: TryGetValue could successfully return true and give back value == null.  In general that's why we use `[MaybeNullWhen(false)]` on generic outs from TryGetValue.  What makes this one special?"
"That makes me more confident that this won't break TS programs. Still, I thought JS functions didn't use contextual typing to find a type from `@github`. Am I wrong?
If functions don't use contextual typing, then methods should use a mechanism similar to the one functions use."
"> Couldn't you go with predictable and safe behavior (although slow)

We considered it and we don't think it's feasible. An unknown number of code bases out there would be negatively impacted, in some cases quite dramatically. To wit, compilation of `immutable.js` slowed down 50x with the candidate PR. It's an awful experience when updating to the latest version of TypeScript all of a sudden hangs your build process. I'd love to do better, but for the moment we don't have other candidate solutions.

Also, it really is relatively rare that the current implementation gets variance measurement wrong. It requires types to be circularly dependent _and_ to flip variance somewhere in the circularity. That happens, but it definitely isn't common.

> I'm worried that by accepting the random behavior now the community will get stuck with it forever

The scenarios in which the issue occurs are rare and well understood, and we'll continue to think about ways in which we can improve accuracy of variance measurement without adversely affecting performance. Nothing prevents us from adopting a better algorithm in the future.

> It should be “contravariant”

Indeed. Thanks for catching that, I have fixed it.

> how measuring is different from what u check and for what u raise errors described in the thread?

Variance measurement is similar to variance annotation checking, but requires more checks. Specifically, we always perform at least two checks (subtype-to-supertype and supertype-to-subtype) to measure variance, and sometimes require a third check to distinguish bivariance from unwitnessed type parameters. In contrast, annotation checking requires only one check for co- or contravariance, and no check at all for invariance."

"@github Thanks for linking the issue and providing more information.

In my opinion, if the API provides method with cancellation token it should be possible to use at
any time. That for a cancellation token is! And also passed timeout treated well and works as
expected in the `NamedPipeClientStream`.

The async-over-sync pattern is implemented by dividing wait time into small pieces to be able check
the passed cancellation token. I think the problem of that PR not in the design domain but just a
regular bug where timeout handled wrong."
They were made to debug any JsonTypeInfo/JsonPropertyInfo issues. There are still couple of other flaky issues other than the one mentioned - I'm not yet sure if that will be useful for debugging those or not. Also this is super useful when making changes and something goes wrong or gets regressed (I had to explore these information many times under debugger when doing prototyping for contract resolver and that actually makes it much easier to extract). I'll leave this for now and we can clean it up once we are confident our tests are not blocking CI runs

"I believe properties that can be deserialized from JSON must have public setters - correct me if I'm wrong on this. If that's the case, we probably don't need users to be able to tinker with the various properties, hence the internal `FileListEntry` and the public `IFileListEntry` that describes those properties as read-only."
"My guess is that your reasoning is that the value *might* in fact be `null`, because JS might return null/undefined, and then STJ will give you `null` at runtime. However that's no more true when calling JS code than it is when calling .NET code (which might have not-null annotation but then actually returns null at runtime).

The best .NET-only analogy for JS interop would be a developer making calls to their own code (because both the .NET and JS parts are typically the developer's own code). When calling your own code, you get to choose what the nullability annotation says on the called-code side, and it's up to you the developer to get that right. If you're wrong, and you say something returns nonnull but it actually returns null at runtime, then you'll get a NRE when dereferencing but that's fine because you shouldn't get it wrong. In this case because the called-code is JS you can't put the nullability annotation there, so you have to put it in the generic parameter to `InvokeAsync` instead. Why shouldn't you be free to specify whatever nullability you want there? If the value might be null, say so, and if not, say not.

The only case I could make for treating .NET specially is that JS return values are more untrusted than .NET return values. If there are reasonable security reasons for needing to check for null return values then I would agree it's helpful to make the compiler guide people to do that. However I can't really think of cases where it would be *more* problematic to get a NRE during dereferencing compared with throwing another exception preemptively due to a null check."

"Not saying this is wrong, but how does this work? So if an exception is thrown, either this runs immediately before catch blocks or not. If it does, then it'll recurse no matter what. If it doesn't...there's basically special magic involved? Then it's not recursive?"
"> If we are concerned about this, can we detect this on the server and throw an exception before we even start sending data? It's not something we care about in general.

Updated accordingly. 

I'd still like to keep the client provided `error` to the `ReceiveJSDataChunk` in case of exceptionary circumstances (ex. something goes wrong with SignalR causing the client to error out). By having the client send the error, the server can proceed to close the pipe and dispose the stream. Let me know if you have concerns with this approach."

"Which is all to suggest that maybe a ""`clang` version check"" is the wrong course of action here, and perhaps instead check for a *file* within the SDK which suggests that arm64 is supported?

Swift documentation appears to be per-ABI, resulting in files such as:

```
/Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk/System/iOSSupport/usr/lib/swift/CoreNFC.swiftmodule/arm64.swiftdoc
```

Xcode 11 has a `CoreNFC.swiftmodule/x86_64.swiftdoc`, but no `arm64.swiftdoc` file.

Alternatively, the `SDKSettings.json` file mentions it:

```
/* /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk//SDKSettings.json */
…
""DeploymentTargetSettingName"":""MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET"",""Archs"":[""x86_64"",""x86_64h"",""arm64""]
…
```

It's all one line, but the Xcode 11 `SDKSettings.json` file doesn't contain *any* mention of arm64`, meaning `grep` may be sufficient:

```
$ grep arm64 /Applications/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.0.sdk//SDKSettings.json 2>&1 > /dev/null && echo yes

"VS can discover the test, but can't run it, local dotnet test can't discover it. What's wrong?"
"I'm currently assuming that I didn't test the Java.Interop commits I thought I was testing.

Or, insanity.

In particular, consider: https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/blob/bc5bcf4f0ef07aab898f2643d2a25f66512d98ed/src/Java.Interop/Java.Interop/JniRuntime.JniMarshalMemberBuilder.cs#L30-L36

This is the `JniRuntime.SetMarshalMemberBuilder()` method:

```csharp
		[System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis.SuppressMessage (""Design"", ""CA1031:Do not catch general exception types"", Justification = ""the *.Export assemblies are optional, so we don't care when they cannot be loaded (they are presumably missing)"")]
#if NET
		[DynamicDependency (DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.PublicParameterlessConstructor, ""Java.Interop.MarshalMemberBuilder"", ""Java.Interop.Export"")]
		[UnconditionalSuppressMessage (""Trimming"", ""IL2026"", Justification = ""DynamicDependency should preserve the constructor."")]
		[UnconditionalSuppressMessage (""Trimming"", ""IL2035"", Justification = ""Java.Interop.Export.dll is not always present."")]
#endif
		partial void SetMarshalMemberBuilder (CreationOptions options)
```

Note in particular that it has custom attributes wrapped in `NET`.

Also note that my fix for `JavaTypeParametersAttribute` was to likewise wrap it in `#if NET`: https://github.com/xamarin/java.interop/pull/929/files#diff-fd9c9afe3c2714f79442afdb021394950e51b6791f835fc8f448e2b3e147e852R3

Thus, the only way `JavaTypeParametersAttribute` should exist is if `NET` is defined.  Yet if I disassemble the `Java.Interop.dll` that was packaged by the installer, *none* of the attributes are emitted.

(Which is differently odd, as `[SuppressMessage]` isn't present *either*!  It's apparently never emitted to IL.)

"While working on this bugfix, I realized that another bug exists:

    ""iterateOn"": ""profiles""
},
{
    ""name"": ""${profile.name}"",
    ""commands"": [ { ""command"": ""newTab"" } ]
}
```

Here, the settings model exports these commands to the command palette as one entry in the name map (the iterable command). This is wrong though, because really the user is explicitly asking for a command named ""${profile.name}"".

**However**, this bug already exists in v1.8, but in a different manifestation.

Here's the encountered behaviors:
- this PR: iterable command wins
- `v1.8` & `main`: whichever command is added second wins (in the case above, nested command)
- expected: no conflict

This bugfix brings us closer to a world where this new bug is fixed. We would need to mess with how we expand commands. But (a) that's too risky for a hotfix and (b) this is a _really_ obscure bug.

"Had no original documents, so can't answer your question, but to correctly handle such things the month and year parts should be avoided, but they still can be received and it will be a valid input. The problem is that it's not compatible with .NET date and time representations.

For example, PostgreSQL has `interval` which stores a duration in three parts: months, days, microseconds. And to handle arithmetic operations properly it deconstructs a `timestamp` into parts, adds an interval to it and then assembles a new `timestamp` again. `timestamp` is a 64 bit integer measuring microseconds.

Unfortunately, `TimeSpan` stores ticks and can't be correctly constructed from any input. For that reason it lacks of `Years` and `Months` properties.

Therefore, while I agree with @github that it's a wrong logic and serialization should not include years and months, deserialization of `TimeSpan` will cause issues if these parts are present. Surely, I can just throw a `NotSupportedException` for such cases and it will solve the problem."

We allow assignment to a target with an optional property when the source doesn't have that property, but we only know that to be true when the source is not subject to further extension (i.e. when source type expresses ""the whole truth""). For that reason, we do have this same problem with type parameters. For example, X = A & T, where X is a type with an optional property p, A is a type that has no property p, and T is a type parameter. If T is instantiated to a type that has a property p with the wrong type, an inconsistency appears. In fact, the same inconsistency exists just with X = T. It all has to do with the way we check optional properties and I'm not sure we can do much about it.

"I’ll describe what happens _before_ this change. This code errors because “No overload matches this call” on the `.filter(...)`:

```ts
interface Success {
    isSuccess: true;
}

interface Fail {
    isSuccess: false;
}

function bar<Q>(a: (Success | Fail)[]) {
    a
        .map(item => ({...item}))
        .filter(value => {
            return value.isSuccess;
        });
}
```

The error elaboration for the overload that ought to match is

```
Overload 2 of 2, '(predicate: (value: { isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; }, index: number, array: ({ isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; })[]) => unknown, thisArg?: any): ({ isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; })[]', gave the following error.
    Argument of type '(value: { isSuccess: true; }) => true' is not assignable to parameter of type '(value: { isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; }, index: number, array: ({ isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; })[]) => unknown'.
      Types of parameters 'value' and 'value' are incompatible.
        Type '{ isSuccess: true; } | { isSuccess: false; }' is not assignable to type '{ isSuccess: true; }'.
          Type '{ isSuccess: false; }' is not assignable to type '{ isSuccess: true; }'.
            Types of property 'isSuccess' are incompatible.
              Type 'false' is not assignable to type 'true'.
```

and quick info on `value` shows `{ isSuccess: true }` instead of the union, providing a clue as to what’s going wrong.

The first important thing that happens is the spread in the `.map(...)` call creates new type identities that are structurally identical to `Success` and `Fail` and `Success | Fail` (which is why printback no longer uses those names afterward), and both the new `{ isSuccess: true }` and the new `{ isSuccess: false }` types share their declaration site at `{ ...item }`.

Where the problem arises is during signature resolution for `.filter(...)`. We try on the first overload, which is

```ts
interface Array<T> {
  // ...
  filter<S extends T>(predicate: (value: T, index: number, array: T[]) => value is S, thisArg?: any): S[];
  // ...
}
```

and try to infer `S`. Since our predicate is not a type predicate, inference initially produces `unknown`, which we will need to replace with the constraint of `T`, which is `{ isSuccess: true } | { isSuccess: false }`. We first instantiate this constraint with the inference context’s non-fixing mapper, which ought to act as the identity function since this type does not reference `S`, but it goes off the rails.

We instantiate each union constituent through `getObjectTypeInstantiation` (we’ve finally made it to the code this PR changes). Recall that _each_ constituent’s symbol’s declaration is `{ ...item }`. We have an outer type parameter `Q`, which should have no effect on the instantiation in the end, but we don’t determine that without trying it. But first, we cache our union constituent `{ isSuccess: true }` as the result of the instantiation for `Q` on the node links for `{ ...item }` (this is the line I removed). When we move on to the second union constituent, `{ isSuccess: false }`, we have a problem: since the declaration is the same, we already have `links.outerTypeParameters` cached, so we move on to the real work of the function (`if (typeParameters.length) { ... }`). We get the `typeArguments` for this instantiation by running the outer type parameters (`Q`) through the inference context’s mapper. Because `Q` was not the inference target, it returns `Q`, so our type arguments are just `Q`. We look up the instantiation for `Q` on the links, and get the result from the previous union constituent, `{ isSuccess: true }`—clearly wrong.

So in short, the union `{ isSuccess: true } | { isSuccess: false }` collapses to the first constituent during an instantiation that should have been a no-op because the first one gets cached as the instantiation of an unused outer type parameter on their shared declaration."

This is not what I expected. But I could reproduce the `Safe handle has been closed` error with few hundred runs. 
With this change I did ~ 5000 runs without single failure. There may be more to it but this definitely seems to help.

I have some ideas why we do not see this more:

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f3390fdb46ece449e15515a925a81aa535059f19/src/libraries/System.Net.Security/src/System/Net/Security/SslSessionsCache.cs#L196-L209

With this we would try to string the cache only on multiples of 32. With certificate, protocols and EncryptionPolicy that generally would be never on clients as there is typically no client certificate, few protocol variations and nobody sane should not use anything but `Encrypt` policy. 

So it tales some effort to even hit the reduction code - perhaps by crafting many unique certificates. 
For future investigations, lowering `CheckExpiredModulo` makes it much easier to test that code. 

While we lock on cache changes, we don't seems to when we retrieving cached value. 
And all the entries stored in the cache are disposed. 
And we seems to allocate a lot while attempting to shrink:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/f3390fdb46ece449e15515a925a81aa535059f19/src/libraries/System.Net.Security/src/System/Net/Security/SslSessionsCache.cs#L224-L225

So while the caching may be improved, I did not find anything particularly wrong. 
My current speculation is that the observed issue is caused by polluting cache with bad values. 
With the added extra check my local runs are now happy.

"> Can we hold off on merging this for a little bit?

Sure. What's wrong?"
"> [RouteTableFactory.cs(57,34)]

You raise a good point about the `[Parameter]` properties, plus I guess any other framework-invoked methods on the component types. I think that so far, this hasn't been an issue because the framework itself doesn't contain routable components, and application code isn't normally trimmed at all. It would only be an issue for RCLs that somebody marks as trimmable (rare).

If there is some way for the `[Route]` attribute (`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.RouteAttribute`, not the one in MVC of course) to cause the trimmer to preserve that type, including all public API, then that would be ideal but I'm not sure the trimmer has a mechanism for this.

> [DynamicComponent.cs(70,17)]

I suspect you're right that the existing annotation is ineffective. It was put there in reaction to trimmer warnings (IIRC).

Regarding the AddAttribute overload proposal, I'm not certain how/if it would work. The point of `DynamicComponent` is to use it with type values that vary at runtime, not just with fixed values. That is, people don't commonly write:

```razor
<DynamicComponent Type=""typeof(SomeComponent)"" />
```

... they commonly write:

```razor
<DynamicComponent Type=""@github"" />

@github {
    Type chosenComponentType;
}
```

So isn't this still an unknowable type as far as the trimmer is concerned? It's not performing some more sophisticated static analysis to work out the possible range of values for `chosenComponentType` based on assignments elsewhere, is it?

If I'm understanding, it seems like:

 * In general we'll continue to expect people not to use it with framework components
 * Most uses with application components are fine because application assemblies aren't trimmed
 * In the edge case of a trim-enabled RCL, people will have to write some other annotation either in their RCL or their application code to say they want to preserve the types they know they'll be using dynamically

If I'm wrong about this, please let me know as that would be great news :)

> [LayoutView.cs(59,24):]

The trimmer's concern (based on the warning) seems not to be about line 59, but about line 60, because the `layoutType` variable gets populated by `GetParentLayoutType` which doesn't declare anything about its return value being preserved. It seems like we *could* annotate `GetParentLayoutType`, but TBH I don't really follow why this would be the right place to annotate this.

I would have thought we should be annotating `LayoutAttribute` so that it knows that its constructor parameter (`Type layoutType`) indicates that we need to preserve the whole of `layoutType` as a component. If that was done, then it seems like `LayoutView` doesn't really need to trigger any preservation of anything, since we already know that all components used as layouts are already preserved. We'd just need to suppress any warnings that emerge from `LayoutView`. This seems like it should work since `[Layout]` is always set statically with a fixed literal type value for the constructor.

Please let me know if I'm misinterpreting all of this!

> [RouteView.cs(80,17):] It seems like there could be a legitimate issue here that could be fixed by annotating the LayoutAttribute constructor parameter with [DynamicallyAccessedMembers(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.All)].

Right, yes! It seems like you're stating the same thing I was suggesting above. So maybe the constructor parameter annotation could solve both of these last two cases. As long as the routable page component itself is preserved, then `[Layout]` should cause its layout component to be preserved, and in turn any chain of ancestor layouts."
"feels weird for the service to have both these methods.  Feels like we'd just want one method, and perhaps have these two as extension methods that both call into that one core method.  (note: i may be wrong about this)."

Yes I have that enabled in both user and workspace settings (ID `workbench.list.horizontalScrolling`).

Not sure how to do this or if I did something wrong?

The entire page is a list, including the breakpoint column. So when scrolling horizontally, it would be scrolled out of the view port. We need a way to fix it from scrolling horizontally. I have tried some methods that works for native table/list like position:sticky, but none of them work.

Also, you didn't answer my second question so I try to add some details here. I would like the indentation the same as what we have currently. But with this PR, the disassembly lines that have source code are not indented correctly:

"> Once you do that, consider removing shell injection altogether. Instead, you can add a button that modifies ~/.zshrc. This would be in line with how zsh ecosystem works.

Our approach is somewhat atypical as most terminals are opt-in with an install step. If I remember right kitty auto installs it and some of the feedback they got was that it's intrusive, which I agree with, so we were trying to be as unintrusive as possible. As soon as you have a manual step the amount of users that would engage with the feature would drop significantly. This is an important part of why we too this approach, we want it to _just work_ for the majority of users and fail unobtrusively for more advanced cases. Imagine connecting VS Code to a container or a new machine, opening a terminal and shell integration/autocomplete just works with zero config, that's the vision.

In the off chance that shell integration fails to inject before the shell starts, or the shell disables it, or something else goes wrong, we want to fail early and continue, then the user has the option to disable injection all together and go with the manual setup route we'll provide https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-docs/issues/5219

This discussion is all super valuable so thank you so much for that! It was probably obvious that I'm not that familiar with zsh, I'm mostly a bash and pwsh user these days. The more we chat, the more I think that it's probably not ready for you to try to integrate since things are still in flux. The best approach to make sure you don't waste time is to just force disable shell integration with our new environment variable and then revisit in a few months?"

Furthermore, adding the files to `@(_MonoUtility)` *feels* wrong because it's placing non-installable artifacts into the ""installable artifacts"" folder.

"> The better (and simpler) question to ask is whether the cacheVariableType as calculated above refers to any method type parameters (I mean from any method) after the substitution. 

Consider the following code. In this case the lambda refers to another method type parameter but there is nothing wrong to cache the delegate because the type parameter has larger scope than the cache.
```
void GenericMethod<T>(T value)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1; i++)
    {
        DoStuff<T>(() => value);
    }

"That's a good idea, but without the commit with create-unions-of-accessors-as-accessors, it adds a weird wrinkle when synthetic properties *are* all accessors: specifically, if you modify accessorsOverrideProperty9 so that all bases use accessors (as in your other comment), then the error shows up again: the base symbol is synthetic, but all 3 bases are accessors, so the exemption no longer applies.

Instead, execution falls through to the flags check, but the flags are wrong, so the error message is wrong.

It's probably more correct to change the way synthetic accessors are created, but it's a much further-reaching change, and most of this code is still needed. I'd rather have a more pressing reason than this to change the code that creates synthetic accessors."
"@github
Thanks a lot for the review. 
The review comments are pretty reasonable, and I strongly agree with them. It is why I left a comment about nearly all of problems https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/38839#issuecomment-973769448
Maybe I could fix `//@github` and remove the commented optimize code.
But I am not sure about throw error. I think we need to discuss the behavior.
``` ts
enum FooKind {
    one,
    two,
    three,
}

interface Foo {
    kind: FooKind
}

function FooFunc(tmp: Foo) {
    switch (tmp.kind) {
        case FooKind.one:
            break;
        case FooKind.two:
            break;
        case FooKind.three:
            break;
        default:
            tmp; // what should here be? should it be `Foo` or `never`?
    }
}   
```
In the new PR, I narrow `tmp` to never, otherwise, what could it be?

Now, let's say we have code `assertNever(tmp.foo)`
I have no idea about what I should do, if I do not change, the build will failed because bootstrap is one step of check(in bootstrap, it will say `tmp` is never, so `tmp.kind` is wrong), if I change it to `assertNever(tmp)`, the build also failed, because tmp is not never now. Do I get something wrong? It would be glad to know there are some methods to fix it correctly!"
"Related to the topic (the info for future readers): here is https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/40101 which allows to use the above technique even without having baseUrl defined (if so, `paths` array values are related to the current config's directory). Which is cool.

Motivation: we switched to within-module-all-relative paths (../../..), and we wanted to have no baseUrl defined anywhere at all. Because it's safer: without baseUrl, VSCode won't even propose non-relative imports in auto-import IntelliSense feature, it would always propose ../.. paths, and there would be no risk of leaking ""wrong"" paths to generated dist/*.js files. (In the past we used typescript-transform-paths, but now we moved off it to reduce complexity.)

Here is the final workable layout. It also illustrates the case when folders in packages/* have different names than package names in package.json files (""my-"" prefix) - not something to be proud of though, but in case it's needed, it works too.

looks like we catch this problem with our asserts but it makes it hard to understand what exactly goes wrong in release and why it leads to bad execution.


I think your test uncovers a bigger issue with `FIELD struct (1 field with the same size)`  transformation like this:
```
LocalAddressVisitor visiting statement:
STMT00017 (IL   ???...  ???)
               [000059] --C---------              *  RETURN    struct

Replacing the field in promoted struct with local var V13
LocalAddressVisitor incrementing ref count from 2 to 3 for implict by-ref V01
LocalAddressVisitor modified statement:

               [000059] --C---------              *  RETURN    struct
               [000149] ------------              \--*  LCL_VAR   ref    V13 tmp9 
```
that can be hit not only for `ref` and not only for trees under return.

I have added another condition to your test so now it fails with the same assert but for `TYP_LONG` so your new condition does not guard against that, but maybe it can't lead to bad execution in release.

[Runtime_44895.modified.txt](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/files/5651339/Runtime_44895.modified.txt)

I think there are 2 main questions:
1. Is it correct to have `GT_OP struct -> LCL_VAR ref` for GC tracking? We are lucky here because there is a limited number of trees which can have struct type and can use `FIELD` as a child (I can think of `RETURN`, `ASG`, `STORE_*`), so we can check all.
2. Should we allow such cases in `gtNewTempAssign`?
3. How big are the diffs if we forbid the optimization in `fgMorphStructField` for 5.0? As I said we don't many `GT_OP struct -> FIELD` cases, so maybe we won't see many regressions?

"@github thanks for pointing that out.

By the time the failure noted in dotnet/performance#1928 happens we have exited the venv. This actually seems to me to be an issue with helix or something else having gone wrong on our machines.

If it is not possible for `propertyInfo` to be null in this case (because you have reasoned about the code and the various states, which the compiler is unable to do in this case), then adding a `Debug.Assert` is useful in catching the null ref bug at development time when the code evolves over time so that the person making the change can see that something went wrong, especially if they accidentally break this invariant (and then can update this method/add tests accordingly). The `Debug.Assert` conveys intent more clearly, imo, particularly when the code changes and test coverage may not be 100%. Otherwise, using the `!` will just hide the null ref until the customer hits it."
"Why?  this seems wrong.  we have ConstructorSymbolReferenceFinder, why is this not there?"
"I think that in general the pattern which is introduced here is a good one - for things which are ""global"" - so things which are needed by the runtime itself and linker won't be able to tell if they're in-use or not. I think COM is a good example, but I might be wrong.

For things which are only needed if some other managed class/method is used we should try to move the dependencies there - to improve trimability. We do care about size even for apps which have enabled debugger support for example.

I don't have a problem with both:
* Adding feature support to `DynamicDependencyAttribute`
* Allowing `DynamicDependencyAttribute` on types (the meaning would be that if we decide to keep the type in any way or form, those dependencies would kick in)

To make progress I think that we should take the changes as Eric wrote them here, it's an improvement as it makes the debugger stuff conditional on a feature switch. And once we have the necessary bits in the linker, we can improve on it by moving more of the local dependencies closer to where they belong."

It does.  It has a fallback where it makes a second FAR request, filtered to definitions, if the first returns exactly two results.  If exactly one is a definition, it jumps between them.  The current (and, I believe, preserved) behavior is that an import counts as a declaration of a separate, alias symbol, so an exported symbol that is exported in exactly one place will cause GTD to hop between the two (since neither is a definition from the other's perspective)."
"> I have undone the changes that were causing following child symlinks by default, this in order to behave similar to windows.

So then this PR is just making a change to follow the symlink if it is the root directory watched, is that correct?  Is that the same as Windows?

I didn't want to imply any sort of right/wrong judgement with my previous comment around following symlinks of child directories.  I actually think that could be seen as an interesting feature that is easier for us to do on Linux due to the way the watching APIs work (we already need to traverse and add and their is a flag for following).  The feature could also be added to the Windows implementation if we shared some of the code that traverses, just rather than add directories it finds (not necessary since ReadDirectoryChanges can be recursive), it could add symlinks it finds.  Interestingly enough if we did that, it would actually be similar to what would be needed to make a complete symlink following solution for Linux as well, since it could cover the symlink-ed file case.  

> It seems there is people in both sides of ""having follow semantics as the default"" or ""make follow links opt-in"" so I think it would not be great to allow that here.

Agreed. I think it'd be possible to have a complete symlink following file-watcher, thought it should probably be opt-in.  IMHO  such a feature would be a nice complement to the other symlink API that's being worked on and would probably be more impactful than this change.

Well, even for non-leaf functions, there would be a problem if the LR was used as a general purpose register between calls.
The real problem is that with the arm64 mechanism of making calls we cannot make unwinding of injected frame to get LR after the unwind to be different from the PC.

"> how did you undo the changes, it's a lot of changes and a large code base

Revert wasn't ideal because:
- There were a lot of conflicts due to code merged since. 
- A fair amount of new use of `!!` has been added since.
- Rolling out `!!` fixed a decent number of (minor) bugs, e.g. wrong parameter name used, missing parameter name, missing tests, argument exceptions propagating asynchronously instead of synchronously out of iterators and async methods, etc. 
- We actually don't want what was there before but instead to use ThrowIfNull, as it's more concise and results in more efficient code, and `!!` is a good indicator of where it can/should be used (`!!` effectively generated ThrowIfNull calls). 

My process:
1. Started by using VS to find expression-bodied members using `!!` and applying a refactoring to make them normal bodies. Most of these were in one LINQ-related file. 
2. Searched for async in combination with `!!` to manually do the ""right thing"" in terms of exceptions propagating synchronously. This found some bugs where we weren't doing it correctly prior to `!! `. Did the same searching for IEnumerable to find iterators, also finding a few bugs `!!` had fixed.
3. Searched for use of `!!` on signatures with this/base delegation to manually handle cases where the check needed to be before delegation. 
4. Wrote a Roslyn-based console app to find all `!!` on parameters, remove them, and add in an appropriate ThrowIfNull call. That handled 95% of the changes. 
5. Searched for ones my tool missed (I knew it would miss some but it was cheaper to do the rest manually than to make the tool bullet-proof), e.g. use on indexers, and fixed those manually. 
6. Built, fixed errors (primarily projects that couldn't use ThrowIfNull), rinsed and repeated until clean. 
7. Manually code-reviewed ~1400 files. Most of the issues here were around trivia my tool didn't handle appropriately, e.g. pragmas at the beginning of a method that got messed up.
8. Mentally praised `!!` and all that it accomplished for us in its few months with us, and put up the PR. "

"This is a bit awkward - sorry I didn't anticipate this when we discussed the design.

In general the intent is for the core `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` package not to make assumptions about the UI rendering technology. As such it doesn't assume that the UI renderer is a browser that would even have an associated JS runtime. The concept of ""web browser"" is in higher layers (e.g., `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Browser`). The reason for this is to keep open the possibility that we allow completely different UI rendering technologies, such as native apps. So, AFAIK (and please correct me if I'm wrong), there aren't any other places in `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` where the framework makes JS interop calls.

To avoid making a JS interop call directly from here, we might need to add a new interface method. We could either:

 * Put a new method, `EnableNavigationInterception`, onto `IUriHelper` (since there are different implementations of that in different environments). It might be a bit weird for this to be public, though.
 * Or make a new internal DI service for enabling navigation interception. It could be a new interface `INavigationInterception` where the existing non-abstract `IUriHelper` implementations (server and WebAssembly variants) also implement that, so there's not much extra code or config to implement. The new interface would just be to segregate it from `IUriHelper` so it doesn't pollute intellisense.

"I've learned the hard way to add a `Thread.Sleep(10)` in the critical part of the changed code when I start benchmarking. This helps me make sure the infrastructure is all set up correctly and I don't make mistakes like benchmarking the old version of the code when I meant to test the new version. If a `Thread.Sleep(10)` was added inside the `if (HasCookie && _headers._Cookie.Count > 1)` condition and the 3 NumCookies variation wasn't horrendously slow, you'd know something was wrong with the benchmark environment or setup."
">out hadNullabilityMismatch [](start = 59, length = 26)

Something seems wrong with this approach. If it is used during initial binding, it should never return hadNullabilityMismatch, or at least it is meaningless to the caller. But this method can't be used after initial binding, as it uses `expr.Type` for the type rather than the type that was computed by flow analysis for the nullable-aware type of the constituent expressions. So based on my reading of the method, something is wrong for either potential caller. #Resolved"

"the state feels wrong. at this point, it knows extension is installed or not, but it doesn't know whether extension is enabled or NOT.

`yield return` is illegal in a lambda. This code was always wrong.
This is a bit crazy to do because for each editor that gets moved it will be opened in the target group causing an editor switch. It would be much smoother if the move would happen with the editors opening `inactive` on the target group and only the last one would actually be `active`. There is an option that can be set when opening an editor called `inactive` that I think we should wire into the moveEditor call so that we can optimize for this (for the `openEditor` call [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/workbench/browser/parts/editor/editorPart.ts#L866)).

> I agree with that. But I don't agree with the approach that has been picked. You should not be reading and evaluating context keys. Instead you should be more like an ""event source"" and we should own the tuple [event, when-clause, command] - just like we do it for keybindings. Something like this
> 
> 1. extension registers event source
> 2. vscode allows to bind events to commands using when-clauses
> 3. extension fires event -> vscode evaluates the binding (using the focused/active element) and invokes the command

So I think an approach like this would solve about a third of the issue, which I guess might make it a good place to start depending on how complex impl would be.  I will try to explain the other 2/3 that's missing from this solution, though.  There are basically two issues not addressed, but I think I can lump them into one with an example.  Here's a sample talon file (the details of kaldi active grammar will likely be different but I'd imagine similar concepts apply; but correct me if I'm wrong here @github):

```
tag: user.terminal
-
make directory: ""mkdir""
```

This code tells talon that when I am in a terminal context, it should listen for me to say ""make directory"", and in response it will simulate keyboard events as if I have typed `mkdir` on my keyboard.  I am not sure I understand how your proposed solution would handle this case.  Somehow talon needs to know that I am in a terminal context in order to activate this command.  A few high-level possibilities for how this might be done:

a) Support a few specific when-clause contexts as contextual substitution variables in the `""window.title""` setting, eg `terminalFocus` and `inQuickOpen`.  Talon has machinery for tracking window titles that is commonly used to solve problems like this.
b) Support a notification and lookup system that tracks what the when-clause context would be if the user were to type a character right now
c) Support just the lookup system from b), so that we can poll this information
d) Pick a few specific when-clause contexts, such as `terminalFocus` and `inQuickOpen`, and create specific apis to query and receive events for them
e) Same as d) but no events, so we'd have to poll for this info

I guess in theory I could solve half of the issue here using your proposed solution with the `workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence` command.  I'd bind an event that triggers this command, qualified by the `terminalFocus` when-clause context.  This only solves half the problem, though, because I'd need to have this command active in talon all the time, so it would still be polluting my command grammar, making misrecognitions more likely, although when it does misfire at least it would end up being a no-op.  But this trick still wouldn't help me with `inQuickOpen`.  

Fwiw, the contexts that I am most interested in are the following:
- `terminalFocus`
- `inQuickOpen`
- `editorFocus`

"You're right, I didn't think about this issue ;  however (and sorry if this a bit dumb) but how would equivalence keys help here ?

The way I would fix this is at line 75, within `FixAllAsync`, by only processing the diagnostic that have the same safety property as the current code action :

- add `private bool _isSafe` to the codefix provider class

- change `RegisterCodeFixesAsync`'s from `var isSafe = /* ... */` to `_isSafe = /* ... */`

- change `FixAllAsync`'s foreach loop to :
```csharp
foreach (var diagnostic in diagnostics.Where(d => _isSafe == d.Properties.TryGetValue(""safe"")) { /* ... */ }

I (very quickly) tested it and it seems to prevent codefixes to affect the wrong version. Would this approach work ?

"> Do we really need to rewrite all of the vectorized code everywhere?

Need to? No.
* Although in the example link you provided there are improvement in .NET 6/7 that would let you simplify some of that logic. We added support for `Vector<nint>` and `Vector<nuint>` so you could merge the `if (IntPtr.Size == 8) {} else {}` paths.

There was an ask above by Stephen for guidance on when the right choice is `Vector<T>` vs `Vector64<T>` vs `Vector128<T>` vs `Vector256<T>`.

There is a lot of nuance here and the guidance I want to write is just that, guidance. Everyone's scenarios are different and hardware is constantly evolving. It's why the architecture optimization manuals are all several hundred pages long. It's a lot like the Framework Design Guidelines where there are some `DOs` some `DO NOTs` some `CONSIDERs` and some `you can always ignore everything here if you know better or your scenario calls for it`.

There is nothing ""wrong"" with using `Vector<T>`, `Vector128<T>`, or `Vector256<T>`. But each come with various annotations and considerations.

The biggest consideration of `Vector<T>` is that it is variable sized. If your inputs are commonly between 16 and 32 bytes (or between 32 and 64 bytes in cases like this PR where it does `Vector<T>.Count * 2`) then you will not get SIMD acceleration when using `Vector<T>` on hardware with AVX2 support.

The biggest consideration of `Vector128<T>` is that you *could* leave some perf on the table if your inputs are commonly ""big"". Big here however is relative and dependent on a few factors. It could be 32-bytes and it could be 128-bytes (it could even be some other number altogether).

The biggest consideration of `Vector256<T>` is that you will not be able to use that path on anything other than modern x86/x64 hardware.

-------------------------

If you are trying to get good performance everywhere and don't need to support .NET Standard. `Vector128<T>` is a good option. `Vector<T>` can also be a good option but comes with more considerations over `Vector128<T>`. Optionally including `Vector256<T>` can then be beneficial.

If you are trying to get the best performance everywhere, you are going to be writing complicated code and maintaining multiple paths; particularly if you need to consider both small and large inputs."

Hrm this is an interesting one. It seems like there is not a perfect solution here -- fetch API seems poorly made. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Without setting a normal redirect status code, we break compat with any existing code handling redirects.

But, it seems wrong to fake a status code when we don't know what the actual status code was. If we were to fake a status code, a temporary redirect seems like the best choice -- permanent redirect could cause dangerous handling e.g. updating a URI in a database.

To add a third bad option, what do we think of this? It at least gives the user some flexibility here.

```c#
public class BrowserHttpHandler
{
    public const HttpStatusCode OpaqueRedirect = (HttpStatusCode)1000;

    // if false, return TemporaryRedirect. if true, return OpaqueRedirect.
    public bool ReturnOpaqueRedirect { get; set; } = false;
}

"> Well, mistakes in past doesn't justify repeating them, especially if we know we could have done it better :)

True. But, if the past mistakes are so prevalent in the existing design, those mistakes can actually _become_ the design. And, trying to do improve upon that results in inconsistency. I believe that's the case here.

> If ""Suggestion"" gets the vote for being a new severity, why not ""Unnecessary""?

I keep repeating this, but ""Unnecessary"" is _intended_ to be combined with a severity. It is 100% by design that code could be faded as ""unnecessary"" and be squiggled as an error. This was designed from the very beginning. Likewise, code can be unnecessary and marked as a suggestion.

> I don't agree with this. Firstly, custom tags are associated with descriptors, i.e. rule metadata, not individual diagnostic instances. Rule metadata represents default information about category of issues created through the descriptor, as deemed appropriate by the analyzer author. Even the unnecessary custom tag added to faded diagnostic becomes non-sensical if user promotes the diagnostic to an error. We need to understand that custom tags is just metadata for class of diagnostics reported via a descriptor.

How is it non-sensical if a user promotes a faded diagnostic to an error? If the user wants to promote remove redundant cast to an error, they should be able to do that and the diagnostic should continue to be faded (because it represents unnecessary code) and underlined with a red squiggle (because it is an error).

That said, ""suggestion"" is a different concept that ""unnecessary"". ""Errors"", ""Warnings"", and ""Suggestions"" are mutually exclusive, which implies that using a custom tag for ""Suggestion"" is a fragile design with invalid combinations.

To be super clear, we're not suggesting that we should allow the DiagnosticSeverity enum to explode. However, after spending the last couple of years building analyzers, and looking at the problem space we believe that there is simply a missing severity. This severity is not so strong as to warrant a warning to inform the user that something is truly wrong with their code. Instead, it is slightly weaker, offering a suggestion to improve the user's code.

You're completely right that suggestions could be achieved by using the Info severity with a custom tag. However, I would argue that we'd just be simulating a severity in that case. And, if we're contemplating the simulation of a severity, I argue that it deserves to be a severity. Otherwise, it becomes an extra complication that every diagnostic host needs handle properly.

The unit of translation is usually a single diagnostic message. We sometimes parameterize based on simple discriminators e.g. saying ""type"" versus ""method"", but nothing more complex than that. I'm happy with your preference, so feel free to leave the diagnostics as is :)"

"> Just curious as I am not knowledgeable about timezones -- what would be the impact of the user picking the wrong one of the several Alaska time zones? They are all -9:00. I'm not sure which -8:00 I should pick for Seattle, even when they are marked Los Angeles and Vancouver.

@github - Indeed, that's a general issue with time zones - there are quite a lot of them.  The reason has to do with historical accuracy.  IANA time zones aim to be accurate from 1970 forward, thus any variation in local time between nearby locations since 1970 get a distinct time zone.

For Alaska, the only two that matter *today* are `America/Anchorage` (UTC-9 with US DST rules) and `America/Adak` (UTC-10 with US DST rules).  But if we look at the [source data](https://github.com/eggert/tz/blob/336c8f8262e31116878b079abba80b1626baaa8f/northamerica#L670-L731) we can see that several other Alaskan time zones have been different in the past (last in 1983 in most cases, except Metlakatla last in 2019).  Since any time zone can be used for the full range of dates available, we show the entire list and it gets large.

For Pacific time, there are three.  Vancouver for Canada, Los Angeles for the USA, and Tijuana for Mexico.  They too have had some historical differences.

Thus, the impact if a user choses the wrong time zone is that they get the changes in UTC offsets and daylight start/stop transition dates for the entire range of that time zone.  If they are only working with ""now"" or nearby dates, that might not be noticed at all.  If they are working with older dates, they could be off by an hour or more depending on the date in question.  The same thing plays out with regard to any anticipated upcoming changes for future dates, if those changes are accounted for in their respective time zones.

Since the only API we have presently is `TimeZoneInfo.GetSystemTimeZones()`, we have to return them *all*.   It might be interesting to consider adding an overload or two that would allow one to supply cut-off dates (or a country code) that could be used to shorten the list.  But that would be something new.

Incidentally, legacy Windows registry-based time zones are fewer in number only because originally Windows hadn't set any particular consistency date (like IANA's 1970).  That changed in 2016 when we formalized some of [Microsoft's time zone policies](https://aka.ms/time) and set a consistency date of 2010.  If they had aimed for 1970 and covering the world, there would be just as many as IANA.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54021

`fr-CA` culture is using time format pattern like `HH 'h' mm 'min' ss 's'` which is causing 2 problems:
- First, we usually derive the time separator from the time pattern. That causing us to use ` h ` as time separator. So, when formatting any DateTime object using this culture we produce wrong formatted time e.g. `10 h 5 h 50 h`. note that ` h ` is used to separate the hour, minute, and second parts in the formatted string.
- Second, the formatted time cannot parse back when using `DateTime.Parse`. This is because we cannot recognize the parts like `min' and 's' in the formatted time.

The fix here is we are special casing this culture to explicitly setting the time separator to `:` which is other French cultures are using. Also, we added some support for this culture in the date/time parser to recognize such formats.

csc -out:bin/BuildRelease/lib/xamarin.android/xbuild/Xamarin/Android/mono-api-html.exe ...

```

Note that it's wrong because it's still trying to build/create `mono-api-html.exe` -- note the `csc /out:` value! -- but it's trying to create a file into a directory which doesn't exist.  (`csc` can't create all intermediate directories?!)"
"Oh all the `.cs` files on my system are LF...

So maybe we have more than just `.txt` wrong?"
Er...what?  Did we always have the wrong declaration?  Did Mono change the declaration?
"I heavily prefer the use of a `Theory`, specifically for the `declarationType` parameter. When the test is broken out into separate tests, it is no longer possible/practical to see two things:

1. Are all cases covered? If it's not a `Theory`, then assume not.
2. Are all related cases covering the same thing? If a typo is fixed in one test input, was it fixed in all? If it's not a `Theory`, then one or more tests is probably wrong.
"
"> I was wondering about the merging too. I dunno; did we set a bad precedent with TerminalCore? 😄

That's exactly what I was looking at... uh oh. But the nice thing now is that all kind of input is consistently in TerminalInput, rather than a random MouseInput object off on the side.

That said, I'll just redirect all calls to `terminalMouseInput` to go through the input buffer instead. I _feel_ like that's cleaner but both of y'all know the code better so let me know if I'm going down the wrong path here."
"No, ConHost is the wrong order since unlike ConHost WT aims (not at high priority, but aims) to support RTL. You can see in the linked issue.
The right version is the correct one for any application which supports RTL."
"Another crazy idea: add `or $(System.JobAttempt) > 1` to the `condition`s, and then we could click the `Rerun stage` button to kick off tests from the UI.  😉

This looks wrong (in fact it doesn't look like there's a `d15-5` branch in the linker repo).
You put the ' at the wrong place on this one (compared the your other advice). It's 'UserNotifications'.
"I agree, it's a bit of a pain to deal with this.

That said, it's not obvious to me how to propagate this to the caller and/or make it easier to debug. Suggestions welcome.

Hopefully this is not a common occurrence -- an exception during a callback means something is deeply, deeply wrong."
"This FileStream is going to be problematic if the file is already present (user wanted to override or simply was wrong). This will override the file no matter what. We should throw an exception if that was not intended and add a -f or --force to the arguments. We can add the new argument in a diff PR, but we should already check for the existence in this one. "
"> This may be a dumb question, but why do we even need the second check? Can null ever be something other than null?

Ideally, no. For this case there's an existing override to the `==` operator, and you would _expect_ that if the first check is true the second is always true. However, since the code for `==` is manually written there could be a bug where the test fails!

I think also for operators like this we usually want to verify that the operators maintain symmetry and general arithmetic correctness - I had to look this one up, explanation here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation

+1 to @github There are no dumb questions 😄 "
"Let's check to see whether a 'ready' already exists on Module here and if so... throw or something, since we've previously had people load us alongside another global-scoped emscripten module and then file confused issues about it.
Doing that is incorrect and they shouldn't expect it to work, we might as well fail early so they know what they did wrong."
"Oh, [we throw](http://source.roslyn.io/#Roslyn.Test.Utilities/MarkupTestFile.cs,171) if markup parsing doesn't work out, so I guess this works. Crazy.

"> I think you're making it harder than it actually is

I know, that's why I'm asking 🙂. There are many things about async code that I am unfamiliar with, so I appreciate the patience and the explanations.

> As written it's an expensive nop that eats all exceptions thrown.

Ah alright, so I had the wrong understanding.

> In general, let exceptions propagate exactly as you normally would in a synchronous method. The only special-cases typically are when doing argument validation in the entry point method.

Thanks, that is the answer I was looking for. I'll adjust the code based on this."
What was wrong here?  Does this belong outside the try-catch?
"We store the hash of files written in bundle emit to ensure that when we try to manipulate the sources for pseudo update (because d.ts of referenced project didnt change so only prepends need to concatenated in right order), we can check if file hasnt changed. This is now needed because bundle buildInfo also stores .d.ts change time and if incremental was toggled between compilations we might use wrong file text and get incorrect d.ts Look at 62c687be8401c0595580db50ca78bc0cfe3613e3 for details"
"@github, what is the breaking change concern here? We're worried someone is relying on this returning the wrong version? I'm fine documenting it as such if we think it is, but I'd be interested in examples where we think it's realistically an issue."
"No, the type of Symbol.iterator here is `any`. Although `any` is normally allowed in computed properties, when you write it in this form (Symbol.something), it is a pretty strong indication that you mean to use a symbol, so we give you an error because you are probably using symbols wrong.
"
"> I have not found any other mechanism for the sorting of the completion items, but using the SortingPrefix feels wrong to me.

This seems fine, as long as it's only part of SortText (and not display/insertiontext).  SortText really just is a lexigographic byte-stream.  So putting in a special 'number' to sort there is fine IMO."
@github thanks for feedback I'd been staring at that for quite a while trying to work out what was wrong; who knew mixing up `true` and `false` could make such a difference 😉
"I tried `getTypeOfSymbol(getSymbolOfNode(...` first. According to my notes, I had trouble getting `typeof C` vs `C` in the static case.

"This bug should not be specific to Decimal. Are you able to reproduce it with a custom type with long field? E.g. `struct MyStruct { int a; int b; long c; }`.

"@github I understand you want to help, but your last few messages have been very off topic (for example, @github's message doesn't reference pnpm even once) and only add noise to what's an already lengthy thread.

I don't have the power to hide comments here, so please understand when I tell you that I really want to keep this thread as much as possible a discussion **between the Yarn and TS teams**, perhaps with occasional displays of support for morale. You're welcome to join our Discord for more general discussions or to suggest alternate implementations, but this PR isn't the right place for that.

That's absolutely wrong. I haven't worked for Facebook for a long time; I wasn't even working there when I opened this PR. For more information, see [Is Yarn operated by Facebook?](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#is-yarn-operated-by-facebook) (but again, realize this is an off topic territory, very out of place for this PR)."
"This fix doesn't seem like it's currently going in the right direction, nor does it have a test case associated. Not sure how comfortable I would feel merging this.

If you're interested in fixing this, then please follow the contribution guidelines. Otherwise, these are good guidelines for isolating the problem. As a start, from what I can see, this is happening from syntax checks in a JavaScript file (i.e. `.js` or `.jsx`) to ensure that TypeScript-specific syntax isn't being used somewhere. This is indicated by the call `getJSSyntacticDiagnosticsForFile`.

Like I mentioned in the review, something is going wrong because some caller is lying about its types. There is exactly one call to `createDiagnosticForNode` that has a type assertion on the node passed in:

```
                        case SyntaxKind.AsExpression:
                            diagnostics.push(createDiagnosticForNode((node as AsExpression).type, Diagnostics.Type_assertion_expressions_can_only_be_used_in_TypeScript_files));
                            return ""skip"";
```

"> Maybe thing's have gotten better since I last tried in macOS world (or maybe I did a bunch of things wrong 😄 ) but the problem with ""data"" keys as I call them is they don't seem to work fully in place of keychain-backed keys. e.g. CopyWithPrivateKey on X509Certificate2 I think was one place that I hit.

I fully expect that to be a problem, just scratching the unit test surface now to decide on a strategy. On iOS the keychain-backed APIs just don't exist so even if this works on a limited API surface it's still better than nothing."
"As I understand `clrx` is used rarely for cases like OS switching threads - so that if one thread preempts another on the same core there is no confusion who has the access. 

Not sure why clang emits it there. Assuming ldaxr and stlxr are used in pairs, nothing would go wrong if monitor is not reset. And it will not last anyways because of context switches, interrupts, etc.

Maybe there is a scenario if you write the actual OS code or a device driver."
"I seem to have generated the tar and tar.gz files from runtime-testdata with the wrong uid and gid, so some tests will fail due to that. I'll have to generate them again with the script and update the package here.

"@github see if this version reads any better. I could pull functionality into the helper struct but have left it basic for now.

Looking at a few of the larger diffs I realized that the existing version of redundant branch opts has a bug; if the tree VN is a constant than the outcome of the branch it controls is independent of any dominating branch, but we were (previously) using inferencing here. This lead to at least one instance where we made the wrong deduction, 57396 in coreclr_tests. Fixing this keeps a bunch of code around that should never have been deleted. I added a note to the code indicating that checking for the constant case is necessary and not just nice to have.

Seemingly these constant VN relops are somewhat rare and having more than one in the right arrangement even rarer, which is why we haven't seen complaints about this before.

The large regression in this method seems to come from LSRA finding many more single-def cases to spill upfront. Did not try and drill into this further.

"Thanks for figuring it out. This would have almost might have made every possible loop's size calculated wrong (it will go all the way to end of the method) and leading to most of the loops being not aligned because of heuristic not met. This would also explain the regression in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/69444.

Does this fix completely remove the checked vs. release diffs?"
"> Looks cool. Just the one case where windows may have a window without a content yet. We may always have a root panel, but maybe some custom handler does not use it.
> 
> Can we do the XamlRoot and get that parent? The root view should have the window as the parent?

XamlRoot doesn't have a parent as far as I can see. That's the topmost level I can get to from the looks of it. From what I can see that _should_ be enough. If the Content for a XamlRoot is null, then the FrameworkElement shouldn't belong to that MAUI IWindow. If you have a FrameworkElement that exists in some other WinUI Window that is totally unrelated to MAUI, and for whatever reason call this API, then the XamlRoot will be wrong for all of the MAUI managed windows and it will return null (which I would expect).

Even if you are doing custom handlers and not using the RootPanel, the XamlRoot on the UIWindow should still be on a MAUI IWindow as well, and if it's not it will return null.
