or we could come up with something else (Xcode version? Something completely different that's calculated in maccore and doesn't take xamarin-macios into account? Go with ""0.0.1"" and decide something later?)

@spouliot / @dalexsoto what do you think? I lean towards the mlaunch version (although the downside here is that there can be multiple mlaunch versions for the same maccore hash)."

> A test can be added to make failure more likely but still any generated code change must be reflected in all the optimizations, that's the contract for any code decorated with [BindingImpl].

True, that's the contract. We're also humans who make mistakes... in theory we'd check that all optimizations continue to work as expected after changing BindingImpl methods, but experience tells me there's a significant chance that won't happen.

> I might have missed something but I don't know why this would be limited to release builds ?

You're right, I got confused.

> It's also only applied on types that are not subclassed. E.g. UIView would not be removed, even if empty, because a lot more logic would be needed to replace the calls (like UIWindow::Dispose back to its base class).

Removing an override is not a binary breaking change: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/

Which means that if UIWindow::Dispose calls UIView::Dispose, and UIView::Dispose is removed, then the call will just go to the next Dispose implemenation further up the chain (which might end up being NSObject::Dispose).

That said, I'm not sure if it would still work if it all happens within the same assembly.

On the other hand I'm wondering if a mix of two other ideas would make this idea more future-proof:

1. Enhance the optimization that removes the null assignment to remove the Handle == IntPtr.Zero check as well. This would mean the only thing left in the Dispose method would be the call to base.
2. Check if there is (or implement) an optimization in the linker (or our own custom steps) that removes virtual overrides that just call base.

This seems both safer/more defensive, and generally more useful (the second part at least, if it's not done already).

Another point is that this optimization will break if we ever change the dispose method to check for NativeHandle.Zero instead of IntPtr.Zero, and there are no tests in this PR to catch this :)"

If you want to refactor code, do it in a separate PR, and make it as clear as possible (PR description / commit message) that there should only be no functional changes.

It's always much easier to review two (or more!) small PRs than a single big one."

No, that's not quite right. The .lastrun files are used to know if the xliff-tasks should check if the translations are out of date, it doesn't determine if the translations actually are out of date.

Looking at the source for xliff-tasks, when they check if a translation is out of date, they actually compare the documents: https://github.com/dotnet/xliff-tasks/blob/cc53f75b404500236364694ff514dcdee2427a94/src/XliffTasks/Model/XlfDocument.cs#L68-L200, but something obviously goes wrong and then that function says that the translation should be updated when it wasn't (because when you run with `/t:UpdateXlfOnBuild` no files are actually modified).

This looks like a bug in the xliff-tasks, I suggest trying to create a small test case and report it to them (or use the small test case to track down the bug in xliff-tasks and just fix it)."
