Unfortunately, the proposed colors aren't accessible so I think it would be best to keep the current colors which have already been tested and validated for accessibility via our templates. 

Naturally, different colors might look better with different samples and scenarios, and folks can always change these styles as they wish. If you want to use grays for the calculator sample, I recommend a light gray button on black background in dark mode! But again, for the templates, I think keeping the current button style (with regard to colors) is ideal in terms of accessibility.
